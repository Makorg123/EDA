The first known case wasidentified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[5]The disease quickly spread worldwide, resulting in theCOVID-19 pandemic.Thesymptoms of COVID‑19are variable but often include fever,[6]cough, headache,[7]fatigue,breathing difficulties,loss of smell, andloss of taste.[8][9][10]Symptoms may begin one to fourteen daysafter exposureto the virus. At least a third of people who are infecteddo not develop noticeable symptoms.[11]Of those who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classified as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mildpneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea,hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure,shock, ormultiorgan dysfunction).[12]Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.[13]Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.[13]COVID‑19 transmitswhen infectious particles are breathed in or come into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. The risk is highest when people are in close proximity, but smallairborneparticles containing the virus can remain suspended in the air and travel over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur when people touch their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus. People remain contagious for up to 20 days and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms.[14]Testing methods for COVID-19to detect the virus\\'snucleic acidincludereal-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT‑PCR),[15][16]transcription-mediated amplification,[15][16][17]andreverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification(RT‑LAMP)[15][16]from anasopharyngeal swab.[18]SeveralCOVID-19 vaccineshave been approved and distributed in various countries, which have initiatedmass vaccination campaigns. Otherpreventive measuresincludephysical or social distancing,quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces,use of face masks or coveringsin public, covering coughs and sneezes,hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. While work is underway todevelop drugsthat inhibit the virus, the primarytreatmentis symptomatic. Management involves thetreatment of symptomsthroughsupportive care,isolation, andexperimental measures.NomenclatureMain article:COVID-19 namingDuring the initial outbreak inWuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\",[19][20][21]with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\".[22][23]In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as theSpanish flu,[24]Middle East respiratory syndrome, andZika virus.[25]In January 2020, theWorld Health Organization(WHO) recommended 2019-nCoV[26]and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease[27]as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus names to preventsocial stigma.[28][29][30]The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020 with COVID-19 being shorthand for \"coronavirus disease 2019\".[31][32]The WHO additionally uses \"the COVID‑19 virus\" and \"the virus responsible for COVID‑19\" in public communications.[31][33]Symptoms and signsMain article:Symptoms of COVID-19Symptomsof COVID-19Thesymptomsof COVID-19 are variable depending on the type of variant contracted, ranging from mild symptoms to a potentially fatal illness.[34][35]Common symptoms includecoughing,fever,loss of smell(anosmia) andtaste(ageusia), with less common ones includingheadaches,nasal congestionandrunny nose,muscle pain,sore throat,diarrhea,eye irritation,[36]and toes swelling or turning purple,[37]and in moderate to severe cases,breathing difficulties.[38]People with the COVID-19 infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough,sputum,shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster withmuscleand joint pain, headache, and fatigue; and a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.[38]In people without prior ear, nose, or throat disorders,loss of tastecombined withloss of smellis associated with COVID-19 and is reported in as many as 88% of symptomatic cases.[39][40][41]Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mildpneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea,hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) that require hospitalization, and 5% of patients develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure, septicshock, ormultiorgan dysfunction) requiring ICU admission.[42][needs update]At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.[43][44]Theseasymptomaticcarriers tend not to get tested and can still spread the disease.[44][45][46][47]Other infected people will develop symptoms later (called \"pre-symptomatic\") or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus.[47]As is common with infections, there isa delaybetween the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. Themediandelay for COVID-19 is four to five days[48]possibly being infectious on 1-4 of those days.[49]Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one symptom within 12 days.[48][50]Most people recover from theacutephase of the disease. However, some people continue to experience a range of effects, such asfatigue, for months, even after recovery.[51]This is the result of a condition calledlong COVID, which can be described as a range of persistent symptoms that continue for weeks or months at a time.[52]Long-term damage to organs has also been observed after the onset of COVID-19. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the potential long-term effects of the disease.[53]TheOmicron variantbecame dominant in the U.S. in December 2021. Symptoms with the Omicron variant are less severe than they are with other variants.[54]ComplicationsMechanisms of SARS-CoV-2cytokine stormand complicationsComplications may includepneumonia,acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS),multi-organ failure,septic shock, and death.[55][56][57][58]Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure,arrhythmias(includingatrial fibrillation),heart inflammation, andthrombosis, particularlyvenous thromboembolism.[59][60][61][62][63][64]Approximately 20–30% of people who present with COVID‑19 haveelevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury.[65][66]Neurologic manifestations includeseizure, stroke,encephalitis, andGuillain–Barré syndrome(which includesloss of motor functions).[67][68]Following the infection, children may developpaediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar toKawasaki disease, which can be fatal.[69][70]In very rare cases, acuteencephalopathycan occur, and it can be considered in those who have been diagnosed with COVID‑19 and have an altered mental status.[71]According to the USCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant women are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID‑19.[72]This is because pregnant women with COVID‑19 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead tomiscarriage,premature deliveryandintrauterine growth restriction.[72]Fungal infections such asaspergillosis,candidiasis,cryptococcosisandmucormycosishave been recorded in patients recovering from COVID‑19.[73][74]CauseCOVID‑19 is caused by infection with astrainofcoronavirusknown as \\'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2\\' (SARS-CoV-2).[75]TransmissionMain article:Transmission of COVID-19Transmissionof COVID‑19COVID-19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated bydroplets/aerosolsand smallairborneparticles containing the virus. Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing.[76][77][78][79]Transmission is more likely the more physically close people are. However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.[76][80]The transmission of the virus is carried out through virus-laden fluid particles, or droplets, which are created in the respiratory tract, and they are expelled by the mouth and the nose. There are three types of transmission: “droplet” and “contact”, which are associated with large droplets, and “airborne”, which is associated with small droplets.[81]If the droplets are above a certain critical size, they settle faster than theyevaporate, and therefore theycontaminatesurfaces surrounding them.[81]Droplets that are below a certain critical size, evaporate faster than they settle; Due to that fact, they formnucleithat remain airborne for an extensive amount of time over extensive distances.[81]Infectivitycan begin four to five days before the onset of symptoms,[82]although contact tracing typically begins only two to three days before symptom onset.[83]Infected people can spread the disease even if they are pre-symptomatic orasymptomatic.[83]Most commonly, the peak viral load inupper respiratory tractsamples occurs close to the time of symptom onset and declines after the first week after symptoms begin.[83]Current evidence suggests a duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness of up to ten days following symptom onset for people with mild to moderate COVID-19, and up to 20 days for persons with severe COVID-19, including immunocompromised people.[84][83]Infectious particles range in size fromaerosolsthat remain suspended in the air for long periods of time to largerdropletsthat remain airborne briefly or fall to the ground.[85][86][87][88]Additionally, COVID-19 research has redefined the traditional understanding of how respiratory viruses are transmitted.[88][89]The largest droplets of respiratory fluid do not travel far, but can be inhaled or land on mucous membranes on the eyes, nose, or mouth to infect.[87]Aerosols are highest in concentration when people are in close proximity, which leads to easier viral transmission when people are physically close,[87][88][89]butairborne transmissioncan occur at longer distances, mainly in locations that are poorly ventilated;[87]in those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.[87][90]VirologyMain article:SARS-CoV-2Illustration ofSARSr-CoVvirionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) is anovelsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to theclusterof acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[91]All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in relatedcoronavirusesin nature,[92]particularly inRhinolophus sinicusaka Chinese horseshoe bats.[93]Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap which bursts itsprotective bubble.[94]Hospital disinfectants, alcohols, heat,povidone-iodine, andultraviolet-C(UV-C) irradiation are also effective disinfection methods for surfaces.[95]SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the originalSARS-CoV.[96]It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genusBetacoronavirus, in subgenusSarbecovirus(lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the wholegenomelevel to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCovRaTG13).[97][98][99]The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 includemembrane glycoprotein(M),envelope protein(E),nucleocapsid protein(N), and thespike protein(S). The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is about 98% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains around 98% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only around 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV.[100]SARS-CoV-2 variantsMain article:Variants of SARS-CoV-2The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into eithercladesorlineages.[101][102]The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages byGISAID,NextstrainandPango. The expert group convened by the WHO recommended the labelling of variants using letters of theGreek alphabet, for example,Alpha,Beta,Delta, andGamma, giving the justification that they \"will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences.\"[103]Nextstraindivides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), whileGISAIDdivides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).[104]The Pango tool groups variants intolineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage.[102][105]Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged throughout 2020.[106][107]Cluster 5emerged amongminksand mink farmers inDenmark.[108]After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, the cluster was assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in Denmark as of 1 February 2021.[109]As of December\\xa02021[update], there are five dominant variants of SARS-CoV-2 spreading among global populations: theAlpha variant(B.1.1.7, formerly called the UK variant), first found in London and Kent, theBeta variant(B.1.351, formerly called the South Africa variant), theGamma variant(P.1, formerly called the Brazil variant), theDelta variant(B.1.617.2, formerly called the India variant),[110]and theOmicron variant(B.1.1.529), which had spread to 57 countries as of 7 December.[111][112]PathophysiologyCOVID‑19pathogenesisThe SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. COVID‑19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).[113]The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via thereceptorfor the enzymeangiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface oftype II alveolar cellsof the lungs.[114]The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell.[115]Respiratory tractFollowing viral entry, COVID‑19 infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways.[116]Nervous systemOne common symptom, loss of smell, results frominfection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to theolfactory neurons.[117]The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in COVID‑19 has been reported in many medical publications.[118]It is clear that many people withCOVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in thecentral nervous system(CNS) of the majority of COVID-19 patients withneurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed.[119]While virus has been detected incerebrospinal fluidof autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.[120][121][122]The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood–brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell.[119]Tropismandmultiple organ injuriesin SARS-CoV-2 infectionResearch conducted when Alpha was the dominant variant has suggested COVID-19 may cause brain damage. It is unknown if such damage is temporary or permanent, and whether Omicron has similar effects.[123][124]Observed individuals infected with COVID-19 (most with mild cases) experienced an additional 0.2% to 2% of brain tissue lost in regions of the brain connected to the sense of smell compared with uninfected individuals, and the overall effect on the brain was equivalent on average to at least one extra year of normal ageing; infected individuals also scored lower on several cognitive tests. All effects were more pronounced among older ages.[125]Gastrointestinal tractThe virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in theglandularcells ofgastric,duodenalandrectalepithelium[126]as well asendothelialcells andenterocytesof thesmall intestine.[127]Cardiovascular systemThe virus can causeacute myocardial injuryand chronic damage to thecardiovascular system.[128][129]An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China,[130]and is more frequent in severe disease.[131]Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.[129]ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.[129][132]A high incidence ofthrombosisandvenous thromboembolismoccurs in people transferred tointensive care unitswith COVID‑19 infections, and may be related to poor prognosis.[133]Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by highD-dimerlevels caused by blood clots) may have a significant role in mortality, incidents of clots leading topulmonary embolisms, andischaemic events(strokes) within the brain found as complications leading to death in people infected with COVID‑19.[134]Infection may initiate a chain ofvasoconstrictive responseswithin the body, including pulmonary vasoconstriction – a possible mechanism in which oxygenation decreases during pneumonia.[134]Furthermore, damage ofarteriolesandcapillarieswas found in brain tissue samples of people who died from COVID‑19.[135][136]COVID‑19 may also cause substantial structural changes toblood cells, sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge.[137]A low level of blood lymphocytesmay result from the virus acting through ACE2-related entry into lymphocytes.[138]Other organsAnother common cause of death is complications related to thekidneys.[134]Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalised patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.[139]Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have founddiffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.[140]ImmunopathologyKey components of theadaptive immune responseto SARS-CoV-2Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevatedIL‑2,IL‑7,IL‑6,granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor(GM‑CSF),interferon gamma-induced protein10(IP‑10),monocyte chemoattractant protein1(MCP1),macrophage inflammatory protein 1‑alpha(MIP‑1‑alpha), andtumour necrosis factor(TNF‑α) indicative ofcytokine release syndrome(CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology.[130]Interferon alphaplays a complex, Janus-faced role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Although it promotes the elimination of virus-infected cells, it also upregulates the expression of ACE-2, thereby facilitating the SARS-Cov2 virus to enter cells and to replicate.[141][142]A competition of negative feedback loops (via protective effects of interferon alpha) and positive feedback loops (via upregulation of ACE-2) is assumed to determine the fate of patients suffering from COVID-19.[143]Additionally, people with COVID‑19 andacute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) have classicalserumbiomarkersof CRS, including elevatedC-reactive protein(CRP),lactate dehydrogenase(LDH),D-dimer, andferritin.[144]Systemic inflammation results invasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secretingT\\xa0cellswere shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secretingmonocytesand severe lung pathology in people with COVID‑19.[145]Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.[140]Viral and host factorsVirus proteinsThe association between SARS-CoV-2 and theRenin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System(RAAS)Multiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus. The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via theACE2receptors. It includes two subunits: S1 and S2. S1 determines the virus-host range and cellular tropism via the receptor-binding domain. S2 mediates the membrane fusion of the virus to its potential cell host via the H1 and HR2, which areheptad repeatregions. Studies have shown that S1 domain inducedIgGandIgAantibody levels at a much higher capacity. It is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective COVID‑19 vaccines.[146]The M protein is the viral protein responsible for the transmembrane transport of nutrients. It is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope.[147]The N and E protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the host\\'s immune response.[147]Host factorsHumanangiotensin converting enzyme 2(hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-CoV-2 virus targets causing COVID‑19. Theoretically, the usage ofangiotensin receptor blockers(ARB) andACE inhibitorsupregulating ACE2 expression might increasemorbiditywith COVID‑19, though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of ARB; however no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes. Until further data is available, guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain.[148]The effect of the virus on ACE2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration, increased blood vessel permeability, alveolar wall permeability, as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants. These effects cause the majority of the respiratory symptoms. However, the aggravation of local inflammation causes a cytokine storm eventually leading to asystemic inflammatory response syndrome.[149]Among healthy adults not exposed to SARS-CoV-2, about 35% haveCD4+T cellsthat recognise the SARS-CoV-2S protein(particularly the S2 subunit) and about 50% react to other proteins of the virus, suggestingcross-reactivityfrom previouscommon coldscaused by other coronaviruses.[150]It is unknown whether different persons use similar antibody genes in response to COVID‑19.[151]Host cytokine responseMild versus severeimmune responseduringvirus infectionThe severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as thecytokine storm.[152]Levels ofinterleukin1B,interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein1 were all associated with COVID‑19 disease severity. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes ofmorbidityand mortality in COVID‑19 disease.[153]A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID‑19, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality. The storm causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, blood clotting events such as strokes, myocardial infarction,encephalitis,acute kidney injury, andvasculitis. The production ofIL-1,IL-2,IL-6,TNF-alpha, andinterferon-gamma, all crucial components of normal immune responses, inadvertently become the causes of a cytokine storm. The cells of thecentral nervous system, themicroglia,neurons, andastrocytes, are also involved in the release ofpro-inflammatory cytokinesaffecting the nervous system, and effects of cytokine storms toward theCNSare not uncommon.[154]Pregnancy responseThere are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that they are prone to have complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures.[155]Physiological responses to pregnancy can include:Immunological: The immunological response to COVID-19, like other viruses, depends on a working immune system. It adapts during pregnancy to allow the development of the foetus whose genetic load is only partially shared with their mother, leading to a different immunological reaction to infections during the course of pregnancy.[155]Respiratory: Many factors can make pregnant women more vulnerable to hard respiratory infections. One of them is the total reduction of the lungs\\' capacity and inability to clear secretions.[155]Coagulation: During pregnancy, there are higher levels of circulating coagulation factors, and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be implicated. The thromboembolic events with associated mortality are a risk for pregnant women.[155]However, from the evidence base, it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of grave consequences of this virus.[155]In addition to the above, other clinical studies have proved that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the period of pregnancy in different ways. On the one hand, there is little evidence of its impact up to 12 weeks gestation. On the other hand, COVID-19 infection may cause increased rates of unfavourable outcomes in the course of the pregnancy. Some examples of these could be foetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, which refers to the foetal death past 22 or 28 completed weeks of pregnancy as well as the death among live-born children up to seven completed days of life.[155]For preterm birth, a 2023 review indicates that there appears to be a correlation with COVID-19.[156]Unvaccinated women in later stages of pregnancy with COVID-19 are more likely than other patients to need very intensive care. Babies born to mothers with COVID-19 are more likely to have breathing problems. Pregnant women are strongly encouraged to getvaccinated.[157]DiagnosisFurther information:COVID-19 testingCOVID‑19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed usingreverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) or othernucleic acidtesting of infected secretions.[18][158]Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection.[159]Detection of a past infection is possible withserological tests, which detectantibodiesproduced by the body in response to the infection.[18]Viral testingMain article:COVID-19 testingDemonstration of anasopharyngeal swabforCOVID‑19 testingThe standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 arenucleic acid tests,[18][160]which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.[161]As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.\"[162]The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by anasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.[163][164]Results are generally available within hours.[18]The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.[165]Several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. Several have been evaluated byPublic Health Englandand approved for use in the UK.[166]TheUniversity of Oxford\\'s CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence[167][168]that \"a good proportion of \\'new\\' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\" and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\"[169]In September 2020, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\".[170]ImagingACTscan of a person with COVID-19 shows lesions (bright regions) in the lungsCT scan of rapid progression stage of COVID-19Chest X-ray showing COVID‑19 pneumoniaChest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening.[159][171]Bilateral multilobarground-glass opacitieswith a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection.[159][172]Subpleural dominance,crazy paving(lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), andconsolidationmay appear as the disease progresses.[159][173]Characteristic imaging features on chestradiographsandcomputed tomography(CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities withoutpleural effusions.[174]Many groups have createdCOVID‑19 datasetsthat include imagery such as theItalian Radiological Societywhich has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.[175]Due to overlap with other infections such asadenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limitedspecificityin identifying COVID‑19.[174]A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and moresensitive.[158]CodingIn late 2019, the WHO assigned emergencyICD-10disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID‑19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.[176]PathologyThe main pathological findings at autopsy are:Macroscopy:pericarditis,lung consolidationandpulmonary oedema[140]Lung findings:minor serousexudation, minorfibrinexudation[140]pulmonary oedema,pneumocytehyperplasia, large atypicalpneumocytes, interstitialinflammationwithlymphocyticinfiltrationandmultinucleated giant cellformation[140]diffuse alveolar damage(DAD) with diffusealveolarexudates.

The valves are a weak point that can transmit the viruses outwards.The WHO and the US CDC recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.[192][193]This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.[193][194]Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.[193][194]A face covering without vents or holes will also filter out particles containing the virus from inhaled and exhaled air, reducing the chances of infection.[195]However, if the mask includes anexhalation valve, a wearer that is infected (and possibly asymptomatic) may transmit the virus through the valve. Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.[196]Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease.[197]When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available. Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged. Healthcare professionals interacting directly with people who have COVID‑19 are advised to userespiratorsat least as protective asNIOSH-certifiedN95or equivalent, in addition to otherpersonal protective equipment.[198]Indoor ventilation and avoiding crowded indoor spacesThe CDC recommends that crowded indoor spaces should be avoided.[199]When indoors, increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air can reduce transmission.[199][200]The WHO recommendsventilationandair filtrationin public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols.[201][202][203]Exhaled respiratory particles can build-up within enclosed spaces with inadequateventilation. The risk of COVID‑19 infection increases especially in spaces where people engage in physical exertion or raise their voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing) as this increases exhalation of respiratory droplets. Prolonged exposure to these conditions, typically more than 15 minutes, leads to higher risk of infection.[199]Displacement ventilationwith large natural inlets can move stale air directly to the exhaust inlaminar flowwhile significantly reducing the concentration of droplets and particles.Passive ventilationreduces energy consumption and maintenance costs but may lackcontrollabilityandheat recovery. Displacement ventilation can also be achieved mechanically with higher energy and maintenance costs. The use of large ducts and openings helps to prevent mixing in closed environments. Recirculation and mixing should be avoided because recirculation prevents dilution of harmful particles and redistributes possibly contaminated air, and mixing increases the concentration and range of infectious particles and keeps larger particles in the air.[204]Hand-washing and hygieneMain article:Hand washingStudents inRwandahand washing and wearing face masks during theCOVID‑19 pandemic in the country.Thorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required.[205]The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one\\'s nose.[206]When soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-basedhand sanitiserwith at least 60% alcohol.[207]For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production. In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises fromethanolorisopropanol.Hydrogen peroxideis used to help eliminatebacterial sporesin the alcohol; it is \"not an active substance for handantisepsis.\"Glycerolis added as ahumectant.[208]Social distancingMain article:Social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemicSocial distancing (also known as physical distancing) includesinfection controlactions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.[209]Many governments are mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.[210]Outbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing.[211][212]In the United States, the prisoner population is ageing and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID‑19 due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease, and poor access to high-quality healthcare.[211]Surface cleaningAfter being expelled from the body, coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days. If a person touches the dirty surface, they may deposit the virus at the eyes, nose, or mouth where it can enter the body and cause infection.[213]Evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of COVID‑19,[214][215][216]leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase ofantimicrobial resistancethrough the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes.[217][218]Deep cleaningand other surface sanitation has been criticised ashygiene theatre, giving a false sense of security against something primarily spread through the air.[219][220]The amount of time that the virus can survive depends significantly on the type of surface, the temperature, and the humidity.[221]Coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to theUV lightinsunlight.[221]Like other enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV-2 survives longest when the temperature is atroom temperatureor lower, and when therelative humidityis low (<50%).[221]On many surfaces, including glass, some types of plastic, stainless steel, and skin, the virus can remain infective for several days indoors at room temperature, or even about a week under ideal conditions.[221][222]On some surfaces, including cotton fabric and copper, the virus usually dies after a few hours.[221]The virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on non-porous surfaces due to capillary action within pores and faster aerosol droplet evaporation.[223][216][221]However, of the many surfaces tested, two with the longest survival times are N95 respirator masks and surgical masks, both of which are considered porous surfaces.[221]The CDC says that in most situations, cleaning surfaces with soap or detergent, not disinfecting, is enough to reduce risk of transmission.[224][225]The CDC recommends that if a COVID‑19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by the ill persons should be disinfected.[226]Surfaces may be decontaminated with 62–71 per centethanol, 50–100 per cent isopropanol, 0.1 per centsodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent hydrogen peroxide, 0.2–7.5 per centpovidone-iodine, or 50–200 ppmhypochlorous acid. Other solutions, such asbenzalkonium chlorideandchlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.Ultraviolet germicidal irradiationmay also be used,[201]although popular devices require5–10\\xa0minexposure and may deteriorate some materials over time.[227]A datasheet comprising the authorised substances to disinfection in the food industry (including suspension or surface tested, kind of surface, use dilution, disinfectant and inoculum volumes) can be seen in the supplementary material of.[217]Self-isolationSelf-isolationat home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID‑19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.[228]Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups.[229]Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID‑19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.[230]International travel-related control measuresA 2021 Cochrane rapid review found that based upon low-certainty evidence, international travel-related control measures such as restricting cross-border travel may help to contain the spread of COVID‑19.[231]Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases.[231]While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up. The review concluded that a minimum 10-day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID‑19 and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening.[231]TreatmentMain article:Treatment and management of COVID-19An overview of COVID-19 therapeutics and drugsAlthough several medications have been approved in different countries as of April 2022, not all countries have these medications. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms who are in the risk groups can takenirmatrelvir/ritonavir(marketed as Paxlovid) orremdesivir, either of which reduces the risk of serious illness or hospitalization.[232]In the US, theBiden Administration COVID-19 action planincludes the Test to Treat initiative, where people can go to a pharmacy, take a COVID test, and immediately receive free Paxlovid if they test positive.[233]Highly effective vaccines have reduced mortality related to SARS-CoV-2; however, for those awaiting vaccination, as well as for the estimated millions of immunocompromised persons who are unlikely to respond robustly to vaccination, treatment remains important.[234]The cornerstone ofmanagement of COVID-19has beensupportive care, which includes treatment torelieve symptoms,fluid therapy,oxygen supportandprone positioningas needed, and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs.[235][236][237]Most cases of COVID-19 are mild. In these, supportive care includes medication such asparacetamolorNSAIDsto relieve symptoms (fever, body aches, cough), proper intake of fluids, rest, andnasal breathing.[238][239][240][241]Good personal hygiene and ahealthy dietare also recommended.[242]As of April 2020 the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) recommended that those who suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at home and wear a face mask.[243]As of November 2020 use of theglucocorticoiddexamethasonehad been strongly recommended in those severe cases treated in hospital with low oxygen levels, to reduce the risk of death.[244][245][246]Noninvasive ventilationand, ultimately, admission to anintensive care unitformechanical ventilationmay be required to support breathing.[247]Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) has been used to address  respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.[248][249]Some of the cases of severe disease course are caused by systemic hyper-inflammation, the so-calledcytokine storm.[250]Prognosis and risk factorsSee also:COVID-19 pandemic death rates by countryThe severity of COVID‑19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as thecommon cold. In 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalisation.[251]Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks.[97]The ItalianIstituto Superiore di Sanitàreported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being hospitalised. However, people transferred to an ICU had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death.[252]Abnormal sodium levels during hospitalisation with COVID-19 are associated with poor prognoses: high sodium with a greater risk of death, and low sodium with an increased chance of needing ventilator support.[253][254]Prolongedprothrombintime and elevatedC-reactive proteinlevels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID‑19 and with a transfer to ICU.[255][256]Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID‑19 will experiencesymptoms lasting longer than a month.[257][258]A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath.[259]On 30 October 2020, WHO chiefTedros Adhanomwarned that \"to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects.\" He has described the vast spectrum of COVID‑19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as \"really concerning\". They range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs\\xa0– including the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic effects. Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body. Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms. Tedros therefore concluded that a strategy of achievingherd immunityby infection, rather than vaccination, is \"morally unconscionable and unfeasible\".[260]In terms of hospital readmissions about 9% of 106,000 individuals had to return for hospital treatment within two months of discharge. The average to readmit was eight days since first hospital visit. There are several risk factors that have been identified as being a cause of multiple admissions to a hospital facility. Among these are advanced age (above 65 years of age) and presence of a chronic condition such as diabetes, COPD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease.[261][262]According toscientific reviewssmokers are more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.[263][264]Acting on the same ACE2 pulmonary receptors affected by smoking, air pollution has been correlated with the disease.[264]Short term[265]and chronic[266]exposure to air pollution seems to enhance morbidity and mortality from COVID‑19.[267][268][269]Pre-existing heart and lung diseases[270]and alsoobesity, especially in conjunction withfatty liver disease, contributes to an increased health risk of COVID‑19.[264][271][272][273]It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2.[274]One research study that looked into the COVID‑19 infections in hospitalised kidney transplant recipients found a mortality rate of 11%.[275]Men with untreatedhypogonadismwere 2.4 times more likely than men with eugonadism to be hospitalised if they contracted COVID-19; Hypogonad men treated withtestosteronewere less likely to be hospitalised for COVID-19 than men who were not treated for hypogonadism.[276]Genetic risk factorsGeneticsplays an important role in the ability to fight off Covid.[277]For instance, those that do not produce detectabletype I interferonsor produceauto-antibodiesagainst these may get much sicker from COVID‑19.[278][279]Genetic screeningis able to detect interferon effector genes.[280]Some genetic variants are risk factors in specific populations. For instance, andalleleof theDOCK2gene (dedicator of cytokinesis 2 gene) is a common risk factor in Asian populations but much less common in Europe. The mutation leads to lower expression of DOCK2 especially in younger patients with severe Covid.[281]In fact, many other genes and genetic variants have been found that determine the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections.[282]ChildrenSee also:Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on childrenWhile very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole.[283][284]Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults.[285]The CDC reports that in the US roughly a third of hospitalised children were admitted to the ICU,[286]while a European multinational study of hospitalised children from June 2020, found that about 8% of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care.[287]Four of the 582 children (0.7%) in the European study died, but the actual mortality rate may be \"substantially lower\" since milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study.[288][289]Longer-term effectsFurther information:Long COVIDSome early studies suggest that 10–20% of people with COVID‑19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month.[290][258]A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems, including fatigue and shortness of breath.[291]About 5–10% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.[292]By a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID‑19.[293]In people requiring hospital admission, up to 98% of CT scans performed show lung abnormalities after 28 days of illness even if they had clinically improved.[294]People with advanced age, severe disease, prolonged ICU stays, or who smoke are more likely to have long-lasting effects, including pulmonary fibrosis.[295]Overall, approximately one-third of those investigated after four weeks will have findings ofpulmonary fibrosisor reduced lung function as measured byDLCO, even in asymptomatic people, but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more time.[293]After severe disease, lung function can take anywhere from three months to a year or more to return to previous levels.[296]The risks ofcognitive deficit,dementia, psychotic disorders, andepilepsyor seizures persists at an increased level two years after infection.[297]ImmunitySee also:COVID-19 vaccineHumanantibody responseto SARS-CoV-2 infectionTheimmune responseby humans to SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of thecell-mediated immunityand antibody production,[298]just as with most other infections.[299]B cells interact with T cells and begin dividing before selection into the plasma cell, partly on the basis of their affinity for antigen.[300]Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains unknown if theimmunityis long-lasting in people who recover from the disease.[301]The presence of neutralising antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection, but the level of neutralising antibody declines with time. Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralising antibody two months after infection. In another study, the level of neutralising antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms. However, the lack of antibodies in the blood does not mean antibodies will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to SARS-CoV-2. Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms.[301]As of August 2021, reinfection with COVID‑19 was possible but uncommon. The first case of reinfection was documented in August 2020.[302]A systematic review found 17 cases of confirmed reinfection in medical literature as of May 2021.[302]With theOmicron variant, as of 2022, reinfections have become common, albeit it is unclear how common.[303]COVID-19 reinfectionsare thought to likely be less severe than primary infections, especially if one was previously infected by the same variant.[303][additional citation(s) needed]MortalityMain articles:COVID-19 pandemicandCOVID-19 pandemic death rates by countrySeveral measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.[304]These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.[305]Themortality ratereflects the number of deaths within a specific demographic group divided by the population of that demographic group. Consequently, the mortality rate reflects the prevalence as well as the severity of the disease within a given population. Mortality rates are highly correlated to age, with relatively low rates for young people and relatively high rates among the elderly.[306][307][308]In fact, one relevant factor of mortality rates is the age structure of the countries\\' populations. For example, the case fatality rate for COVID‑19 is lower in India than in the US since India\\'s younger population represents a larger percentage than in the US.[309]Case fatality rateThecase fatality rate(CFR) reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is1.02% (6,881,955/676,609,955) as of 10 March 2023.[4]The number varies by region.[310][311]Total confirmed cases over timeTotal confirmed cases of COVID‑19 per million people[312]Total confirmed deaths over timeTotal confirmed deaths due to COVID‑19 per million people[313]Infection fatality rateA key metric in gauging the severity of COVID‑19 is theinfection fatality rate(IFR), also referred to as theinfection fatality ratioorinfection fatality risk.[314][315][316]This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to theCFR, the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases.[317]EstimatesThe red line shows the estimate of infection fatality rate (IFR), in percentage terms, as a function of age. The shaded region depicts the 95% confidence interval for that estimate. Markers denotes specific observations used in the meta-analysis.[318]The same relationship plotted on a log scaleA December 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that population IFR during the first wave of the pandemic was about 0.5% to 1% in many locations (including France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), 1% to 2% in other locations (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and exceeded 2% in Italy.[318]That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85.[318]These results were also highlighted in a December 2020 report issued by the WHO.[319]IFR estimate per age group(to December 2020)[318]Age groupIFR0–340.004%35–440.068%45–540.23%55–640.75%65–742.5%75–848.5%85\\u2009+28.3%An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID‑19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualised risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonalinfluenza.[318]Earlier estimates of IFRAt an early stage of the pandemic, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between 0.3% and 1%.[320][321]On 2July, The WHO\\'s chief scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6%.[322][323]In August, the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%.[324]Firm lower limits of IFRs have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot be less than the population fatality rate. (After sufficient time however, people can get reinfected).[325]As of 10 July, in New York City, with a population of 8.4\\xa0million, 23,377 individuals (18,758 confirmed and 4,619 probable) have died with COVID‑19 (0.3% of the population).[326]Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of ≈0.9%,[327]and ≈1.4%.[328]InBergamo province, 0.6% of the population has died.[329]In September 2020, the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) reported preliminary estimates of age-specific IFRs for public health planning purposes.[330]Sex differencesMain article:Gendered impact of the COVID-19 pandemicEstimated prognosis by age and sexbased on cases fromFranceandDiamond Princess ship[331]Percentage of infected people who are hospitalised0–1920–2930–3940–4950–5960–6970–7980+TotalFemale0.1(0.07–0.2)0.5(0.3–0.8)0.9(0.5–1.5)1.3(0.7–2.1)2.6(1.5–4.2)5.1(2.9–8.3)7.8(4.4–12.8)19.3(10.9–31.6)2.6(1.5–4.3)Male0.2(0.08–0.2)0.6(0.3–0.9)1.2(0.7–1.9)1.6(0.9–2.6)3.2(1.8–5.2)6.7(3.7–10.9)11.0(6.2–17.9)37.6(21.1–61.3)3.3(1.8–5.3)Total0.1(0.08–0.2)0.5(0.3–0.8)1.1(0.6–1.7)1.4(0.8–2.3)2.9(1.6–4.7)5.8(3.3–9.5)9.3(5.2–15.1)26.2(14.8–42.7)2.9(1.7–4.8)Percentage of hospitalised people who go to Intensive Care Unit0–1920–2930–3940–4950–5960–6970–7980+TotalFemale16.7(14.3–19.3)8.7(7.5–9.9)11.9(10.9–13.0)16.6(15.6–17.7)20.7(19.8–21.6)23.1(22.2–24.0)18.7(18.0–19.5)4.2(4.0–4.5)14.3(13.9–14.7)Male26.9(23.1–31.1)14.0(12.2–16.0)19.2(17.6–20.9)26.9(25.4–28.4)33.4(32.0–34.8)37.3(36.0–38.6)30.2(29.1–31.3)6.8(6.5–7.2)23.1(22.6–23.6)Total22.2(19.1–25.7)11.6(10.1–13.2)15.9(14.5–17.3)22.2(21.0–23.5)27.6(26.5–28.7)30.8(29.8–31.8)24.9(24.1–25.8)5.6(5.3–5.9)19.0(18.7–19.44)Percent of hospitalised people who die0–1920–2930–3940–4950–5960–6970–7980+TotalFemale0.5(0.2–1.0)0.9(0.5–1.3)1.5(1.2–1.9)2.6(2.3–3.0)5.2(4.8–5.6)10.1(9.5–10.6)16.7(16.0–17.4)25.2(24.4–26.0)14.4(14.0–14.8)Male0.7(0.3–1.5)1.3(0.8–1.9)2.2(1.7–2.7)3.8(3.3–4.4)7.6(7.0–8.2)14.8(14.1–15.6)24.6(23.7–25.6)37.1(36.1–38.2)21.2(20.8–21.7)Total0.6(0.2–1.3)1.1(0.7–1.6)1.9(1.5–2.3)3.3(2.9–3.8)6.5(6.0–7.0)12.6(12.0–13.2)21.0(20.3–21.7)31.6(30.9–32.4)18.1(17.8–18.4)Percent of infected people who die\\xa0– infection fatality rate (IFR)0–1920–2930–3940–4950–5960–6970–7980+TotalFemale0.001(<0.001–0.002)0.004(0.002–0.007)0.01(0.007–0.02)0.03(0.02–0.06)0.1(0.08–0.2)0.5(0.3–0.8)1.3(0.7–2.1)4.9(2.7–8.0)0.4(0.2–0.6)Male0.001(<0.001–0.003)0.007(0.003–0.01)0.03(0.02–0.05)0.06(0.03–0.1)0.2(0.1–0.4)1.0(0.6–1.6)2.7(1.5–1.4)14.0(7.9–22.7)0.7(0.4–1.1)Total0.001(<0.001–0.002)0.005(0.003–0.01)0.02(0.01–0.03)0.05(0.03–0.08)0.2(0.1–0.3)0.7(0.4–1.2)1.9(1.1–3.2)8.3(4.7–13.5)0.5(0.3–0.9)Numbers in parentheses are 95%credible intervalsfor the estimates.COVID‑19case fatality ratesare higher among men than women in most countries. However, in a few countries like India, Nepal, Vietnam, and Slovenia the fatality cases are higher in women than men.[309]Globally, men are more likely to be admitted to theICUand more likely to die.[332][333]One meta-analysis found that globally, men were more likely to get COVID‑19 than women; there were approximately 55 men and 45 women per 100 infections (CI: 51.43–56.58).[334]TheChinese Center for Disease Control and Preventionreported the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.[335]Later reviews in June 2020 indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in CFR between genders.[336][337]One review acknowledges the different mortality rates in Chinese men, suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors.[338]Smoking, which in some countries like China is mainly a male activity, is a habit that contributes to increasing significantly the case fatality rates among men.[309]Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men.[339]In Europe as of February 2020, 57% of the infected people were men and 72% of those died with COVID‑19 were men.[340]As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID‑19 infections.[341]Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.[341]Ethnic differencesIn the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID‑19 have occurred among African Americans and other minority groups.[342]Structural factors that prevent them from practising social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in \"essential\" occupations such as retail grocery workers, public transit employees, health-care workers and custodial staff. Greater prevalence of lackinghealth insuranceand care of underlying conditions such asdiabetes,[343]hypertension, andheart diseasealso increase their risk of death.[344]Similar issues affectNative AmericanandLatinocommunities.[342]On the one hand, in the Dominican Republic there is a clear example of both gender and ethnic inequality. In this Latin American territory, there is great inequality and precariousness that especially affects Dominican women, with greater emphasis on those of Haitian descent.[345]According to a US health policy non-profit, 34% of American Indian and Alaska Native People (AIAN) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly adults.[346]The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water.[347]Leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities.[348]In the UK, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID‑19 have occurred in those of aBlack,Asian, and other ethnic minority background.[349][350][351]More severe impacts upon patients including the relative incidence of the necessity of hospitalisation requirements, and vulnerability to the disease has been associated via DNA analysis to be expressed in genetic variants at chromosomal region 3, features that are associated with EuropeanNeanderthalheritage. That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease.[352]The findings are from Professor Svante Pääbo and researchers he leads at theMax Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropologyand theKarolinska Institutet.[352]This admixture of modern human and Neanderthal genes is estimated to have occurred roughly between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago in Southern Europe.[352]ComorbiditiesBiologicalfactors (immune response) and the general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID‑19.[309]Most of those who die of COVID‑19 havepre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension,diabetes mellitus,[343]andcardiovascular disease.[353]According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions.[354]The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths wheremedical chartswere available, 96.1% of people had at least onecomorbiditywith the average person having 3.4 diseases.[252]According to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension (66% of deaths),type\\xa02 diabetes(29.8% of deaths),ischaemic heart disease(27.6% of deaths),atrial fibrillation(23.1% of deaths) andchronic renal failure(20.2% of deaths).Most critical respiratory comorbidities according to the USCenters for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), are: moderate or severeasthma, pre-existingCOPD,pulmonary fibrosis,cystic fibrosis.[355]Evidence stemming frommeta-analysisof several smaller research papers also suggests that smoking can be associated with worse outcomes.[356][357]When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms.[358]COVID‑19 also poses a greater risk to people whomisuse opioidsandamphetamines, insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage.[359]In August 2020, the CDC issued a caution thattuberculosis(TB) infections could increase the risk of severe illness or death. The WHO recommended that people with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for COVID‑19 could not rule out co-infections. Some projections have estimated that reduced TB detection due to the pandemic could result in 6.3\\xa0million additional TB cases and 1.4\\xa0million TB-related deaths by 2025.[360]HistoryMain

early 2021 by the People\\'s Republic of China and theWorld Health Organizationindicated that the virus descended from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and likely spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host.[363]There are several theories about where theindex caseoriginated andinvestigations into the origin of the pandemicare ongoing.[364]According to articles published in July 2022 inScience, virus transmission into humans occurred through two spillover events in November 2019 and was likely due to live wildlife trade on theHuanan wet marketin the city ofWuhan(Hubei, China).[365][366][367]Doubts about the conclusions have mostly centered on the precise site of spillover.[368]Earlierphylogeneticsestimated that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019.[369][370][371]A phylogenetic algorithm analysis suggested that the virus may have been circulating inGuangdongbefore Wuhan.[372]Most scientists believe the virus spilled into human populations through naturalzoonosis, similar to theSARS-CoV-1andMERS-CoVoutbreaks, and consistent with other pandemics in human history.[373][374]According to theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeseveral social and environmental factors includingclimate change,natural ecosystem destructionandwildlife tradeincreased the likelihood of suchzoonotic spillover.[375][376]One study made with the support of theEuropean Unionfoundclimate changeincreased the likelihood of the pandemic by influencing distribution of bat species.[377][378]Available evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was originally harboured by bats, and spread to humans multiple times from infected wild animals at theHuanan Seafood MarketinWuhanin December 2019.[373][374]A minority of scientists and some members of theU.S intelligence communitybelieve the virus may have beenunintentionally leakedfrom a laboratory such as theWuhan Institute of Virology.[379][380]The US intelligence community has mixed views on the issue,[381][382]but overall agrees with the scientific consensus that the virus was not developed as abiological weaponand is unlikely to have beengenetically engineered.[383][384][385][386]There is no evidence SARS-CoV-2 existed in any laboratory prior to the pandemic.[387][388][389]The first confirmed human infections were in Wuhan. A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID‑19, published in January 2020 inThe Lancet, reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1December 2019.[390][391][392]Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8December 2019.[393]Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20 January 2020.[394][395]According to official Chinese sources, these were mostly linked to theHuanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.[396]In May 2020,George Gao, the director of the CDC, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating that the market was the site of an earlysuperspreading event, but that it was not the site of the initial outbreak.[397]Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater samples that were collected inMilanandTurin, Italy, on 18 December 2019.[398]By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.[335][399]The number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 December,[400]and at least 266 by 31 December.[401]On 24 December,Wuhan Central Hospitalsent abronchoalveolar lavage fluid(BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.[402]A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctorZhang Jixianin Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[403]On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result forSARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on \"the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause\" that same evening.[404]Eight of these doctors, includingLi Wenliang(punished on 3January),[405]were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours and another,Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.[406]The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on 31 December, confirming 27 cases[407][408][409]– enough to trigger an investigation.[410]During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[411]In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to otherChinese provinces, helped by theChinese New Year migrationand Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.[97]On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one inShenzhen.[412]Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then,[335]and more may have been infected.[413]A report inThe Lanceton 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its \"pandemic potential\".[130][414]On 30 January, the WHO declared COVID-19 aPublic Health Emergency of International Concern.[413]By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times.[415]Italy had its first confirmed cases on 31 January 2020, two tourists from China.[416]Italy overtook China as the country with the most deaths on 19 March 2020.[417]By 26 March the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.[418]Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases inNew Yorkcame from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.[419]Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019,[420][421]and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6February 2020.[422]RT-PCR testing of untreated wastewater samples from Brazil and Italy have suggested detection of SARS-CoV-2 as early as November and December 2019, respectively, but the methods of such sewage studies have not been optimised, many have not been peer-reviewed, details are often missing, and there is a risk of false positives due to contamination or if only one gene target is detected.[423]A September 2020 review journal article said, \"The possibility that the COVID‑19 infection had already spread to Europe at the end of last year is now indicated by abundant, even if partially circumstantial, evidence,\" including pneumonia case numbers and radiology in France and Italy in November and December.[424]As of 1\\xa0October\\xa02021[update],Reutersreported that it had estimated the worldwide total number of deaths due to COVID‑19 to have exceeded five million.[425]MisinformationMain article:COVID-19 misinformationAfter the initial outbreak of COVID‑19,misinformationanddisinformationregarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online.[426][427][428]In September 2020, the USCenters for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) published preliminary estimates of the risk of death by age groups in the United States, but those estimates were widely misreported and misunderstood.[429][430]Other speciesSee also:Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on animalsHumans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals,[431][432]a type of disease transmission referred to aszooanthroponosis.[433][434]Some pets, especially cats andferrets, can catch this virus from infected humans.[435][436]Symptoms in cats includerespiratory(such as a cough) and digestive symptoms.[435]Cats can spread the virus to other cats, and may be able to spread the virus to humans, but cat-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been proven.[435][437]Compared to cats, dogs are less susceptible to this infection.[437]Behaviours which increase the risk of transmission include kissing, licking, and petting the animal.[437]The virus does not appear to be able to infectpigs,ducks, or chickens at all.[435]Mice, rats, and rabbits, if they can be infected at all, are unlikely to be involved in spreading the virus.[437]Tigers and lions in zoos have become infected as a result of contact with infected humans.[437]As expected, monkeys andgreat apespecies such asorangutanscan also be infected with the COVID‑19 virus.[437]Minks, which are in thesame familyas ferrets, have been infected.[437]Minks may be asymptomatic, and can also spread the virus to humans.[437]Multiple countries have identified infected animals inmink farms.[438]Denmark, a major producer of mink pelts, ordered the slaughter of all minks over fears of viral mutations,[438]following an outbreak referred to asCluster 5. A vaccine for mink and other animals is being researched.[438]ResearchFurther information:COVID-19 drug developmentInternational research on vaccines and medicines in COVID‑19 is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers.[439][440]The CDC has classified it to require aBSL3grade laboratory.[441]There has been a great deal of COVID‑19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand.[442]As of December\\xa02020[update], hundreds ofclinical trialshave been undertaken, with research happening on every continent exceptAntarctica.[443]As of November\\xa02020[update], more than 200 possible treatments have been studied in humans.[444]Transmission and prevention researchFurther information:COVID-19 vaccineModellingresearch has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of transmission,[445]diagnosis and prognosis of infection,[446]estimation of the impact of interventions,[447][448]or allocation of resources.[449]Modelling studies are mostly based oncompartmental models in epidemiology,[450]estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions. Several other types of models have been developed and used during the COVID‑19 pandemic includingcomputational fluid dynamicsmodels to study the flow physics of COVID‑19,[451]retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant exposure,[452]mobility-data based models to investigate transmission,[453]or the use ofmacroeconomicmodels to assess the economic impact of the pandemic.[454]Treatment-related researchMain article:COVID-19 drug repurposing researchSeven possible drug targets in viral replication process and drugsRepurposedantiviral drugsmake up most of the research into COVID‑19 treatments.[455][456]Other candidates in trials includevasodilators,corticosteroids, immune therapies,lipoic acid,bevacizumab, andrecombinantangiotensin-converting enzyme 2.[456]In March 2020, theWorld Health Organization(WHO) initiated theSolidarity trialto assess the treatment effects of some promising drugs: anexperimental drugcalled remdesivir;anti-malarialdrugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; twoanti-HIV drugs,lopinavir/ritonavir; andinterferon-beta.[457][458]More than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.[66]Research on the antimalarial drugshydroxychloroquineandchloroquineshowed that they were ineffective at best,[459][460]and that they may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir.[461]By May 2020[update], France, Italy, and Belgium had banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID‑19 treatment.[462]In June, initial results from the randomisedRECOVERY Trialin the United Kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one third for people who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental oxygen.[463]Because this is a well-tested and widely available treatment, it was welcomed by the WHO, which is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone and other steroids.[464][465]Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the NIH for patients with COVID‑19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID‑19 who do not require supplemental oxygen.[466]In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID‑19.[467][468]The WHO recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and critical COVID‑19 (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence).[467]The WHO suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with non-severe COVID‑19 (conditional recommendation, based on low certainty evidence).[467]The updated guidance was based on a meta-analysis of clinical trials of critically ill COVID‑19 patients.[469][470]In September 2020, theEuropean Medicines Agency(EMA) endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents from twelve years of age and weighing at least 40 kilograms (88\\xa0lb) who require supplemental oxygen therapy.[471][472]Dexamethasone can be takenby mouthor given as an injection orinfusion (drip) into a vein.[471]In November 2020, the USFood and Drug Administration(FDA) issued an emergency use authorisation for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapybamlanivimabfor the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID‑19.[473]Bamlanivimab is authorised for people with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing who are twelve years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (88\\xa0lb), and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID‑19 or hospitalisation.[473]This includes those who are 65 years of age or older, or who have chronic medical conditions.[473]In February 2021, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation (EUA) for bamlanivimab andetesevimabadministered together for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID‑19 in people twelve years of age or older weighing at least 40 kilograms (88\\xa0lb) who test positive for SARS‑CoV‑2 and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID‑19. The authorised use includes treatment for those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions.[474]In April 2021, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorisation (EUA) that allowed for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab, when administered alone, to be used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID‑19 in adults and certain paediatric patients.[475]Cytokine stormVarious therapeutic strategies for targeting cytokine stormAcytokine stormcan be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID‑19. A cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction where a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines andchemokinesare released too quickly. A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure.[476]Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID‑19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses. These high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a cytokine storm.[477]Tocilizumabhas been included in treatment guidelines by China\\'sNational Health Commissionafter a small study was completed.[478][479]It is undergoing aPhaseIInon-randomised trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.[480][481]Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.[482]Theinterleukin-6 receptor(IL-6R)antagonistwas approved by the FDA to undergo a PhaseIII clinical trial assessing its effectiveness on COVID‑19 based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause,CAR T celltherapy, in 2017.[483]There is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS. Prophylactic tocilizumab has been shown to increase serum IL-6 levels by saturating the IL-6R, driving IL-6 across theblood–brain barrier, and exacerbatingneurotoxicitywhile having no effect on the incidence of CRS.[484]Lenzilumab, an anti-GM-CSFmonoclonal antibody, is protective in murine models for CAR T cell-induced CRS and neurotoxicity and is a viable therapeutic option due to the observed increase of pathogenic GM-CSF secreting Tcells in hospitalised patients with COVID‑19.[485]Passive antibodiesOverview of the application and use ofconvalescent plasmatherapyTransferring purified and concentratedantibodiesproduced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID‑19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method ofpassive immunisation.[486][487][needs update]Viral neutralisationis the anticipatedmechanism of actionby which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralising antibodies.[488]As of 8August 2020, eight neutralising antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies.[489]It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID‑19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections.[488]Other mechanisms, however, such asantibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicityorphagocytosis, may be possible.[486]Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.[486]The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID‑19 is also being studied. This involves the production ofconvalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to this virus, which is then administered to active patients.[486]This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.[486]An updated Cochrane review in May 2021 found high certainty evidence that, for the treatment of people with moderate to severe COVID‑19, convalescent plasma did not reduce mortality or bring about symptom improvement.[487]There continues to be uncertainty about the safety of convalescent plasma administration to people with COVID‑19 and differing outcomes measured in different studies limits their use in determining efficacy.[487]BioethicsSince the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic, scholars have explored thebioethics,normative economics, andpolitical theoriesofhealthcare policiesrelated to the public health crisis.[490]Academics have pointed to the moral distress of healthcare workers, ethics of distributing scarce healthcare resources such as ventilators,[491]and the global justice of vaccine diplomacies.[citation needed]The socio-economic inequalities between genders,[492]races,[493]groups with disabilities,[494]communities,[495]regions, countries,[496]and continents have also drawn attention in academia and the general public.Effects on other diseasesThe use ofsocial distancingand the wearing ofsurgical masksand similar precautions against COVID‑19 may have caused a drop in the spread of thecommon coldand theflu.[497][498]See alsoCoronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromesDisease X, a WHO termLaw of declining virulence– Disproved hypothesis of epidemiologist Theobald SmithTheory of virulence– Theory by biologist Paul W.

The first known case wasidentified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease quickly spread worldwide, resulting in theCOVID-19 pandemic.Thesymptoms of COVID‑19are variable but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue,breathing difficulties,loss of smell, andloss of taste.   Symptoms may begin one to fourteen daysafter exposureto the virus. At least a third of people who are infecteddo not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classified as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mildpneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea,hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure,shock, ormultiorgan dysfunction). Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. COVID‑19 transmitswhen infectious particles are breathed in or come into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. The risk is highest when people are in close proximity, but smallairborneparticles containing the virus can remain suspended in the air and travel over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur when people touch their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus. People remain contagious for up to 20 days and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms. Testing methods for COVID-19to detect the virus\\'snucleic acidincludereal-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT‑PCR),  transcription-mediated amplification,   andreverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification(RT‑LAMP)  from anasopharyngeal swab. SeveralCOVID-19 vaccineshave been approved and distributed in various countries, which have initiatedmass vaccination campaigns. Otherpreventive measuresincludephysical or social distancing,quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces,use of face masks or coveringsin public, covering coughs and sneezes,hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. While work is underway todevelop drugsthat inhibit the virus, the primarytreatmentis symptomatic. Management involves thetreatment of symptomsthroughsupportive care,isolation, andexperimental measures.NomenclatureMain article:COVID-19 namingDuring the initial outbreak inWuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\",   with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\".  In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as theSpanish flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, andZika virus. In January 2020, theWorld Health Organization(WHO) recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus names to preventsocial stigma.   The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020 with COVID-19 being shorthand for \"coronavirus disease 2019\".  The WHO additionally uses \"the COVID‑19 virus\" and \"the virus responsible for COVID‑19\" in public communications.  Symptoms and signsMain article:Symptoms of COVID-19Symptomsof COVID-19Thesymptomsof COVID-19 are variable depending on the type of variant contracted, ranging from mild symptoms to a potentially fatal illness.  Common symptoms includecoughing,fever,loss of smell(anosmia) andtaste(ageusia), with less common ones includingheadaches,nasal congestionandrunny nose,muscle pain,sore throat,diarrhea,eye irritation, and toes swelling or turning purple, and in moderate to severe cases,breathing difficulties. People with the COVID-19 infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough,sputum,shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster withmuscleand joint pain, headache, and fatigue; and a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. In people without prior ear, nose, or throat disorders,loss of tastecombined withloss of smellis associated with COVID-19 and is reported in as many as 88% of symptomatic cases.   Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mildpneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea,hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) that require hospitalization, and 5% of patients develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure, septicshock, ormultiorgan dysfunction) requiring ICU admission. [needs update]At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.  Theseasymptomaticcarriers tend not to get tested and can still spread the disease.    Other infected people will develop symptoms later (called \"pre-symptomatic\") or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus. As is common with infections, there isa delaybetween the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. Themediandelay for COVID-19 is four to five days possibly being infectious on 1-4 of those days. Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one symptom within 12 days.  Most people recover from theacutephase of the disease. However, some people continue to experience a range of effects, such asfatigue, for months, even after recovery. This is the result of a condition calledlong COVID, which can be described as a range of persistent symptoms that continue for weeks or months at a time. Long-term damage to organs has also been observed after the onset of COVID-19. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the potential long-term effects of the disease. TheOmicron variantbecame dominant in the U.S. in December 2021. Symptoms with the Omicron variant are less severe than they are with other variants. ComplicationsMechanisms of SARS-CoV-2cytokine stormand complicationsComplications may includepneumonia,acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS),multi-organ failure,septic shock, and death.    Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure,arrhythmias(includingatrial fibrillation),heart inflammation, andthrombosis, particularlyvenous thromboembolism.      Approximately 20–30% of people who present with COVID‑19 haveelevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury.  Neurologic manifestations includeseizure, stroke,encephalitis, andGuillain–Barré syndrome(which includesloss of motor functions).  Following the infection, children may developpaediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar toKawasaki disease, which can be fatal.  In very rare cases, acuteencephalopathycan occur, and it can be considered in those who have been diagnosed with COVID‑19 and have an altered mental status. According to the USCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant women are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID‑19. This is because pregnant women with COVID‑19 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead tomiscarriage,premature deliveryandintrauterine growth restriction. Fungal infections such asaspergillosis,candidiasis,cryptococcosisandmucormycosishave been recorded in patients recovering from COVID‑19.  CauseCOVID‑19 is caused by infection with astrainofcoronavirusknown as \\'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2\\' (SARS-CoV-2). TransmissionMain article:Transmission of COVID-19Transmissionof COVID‑19COVID-19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated bydroplets/aerosolsand smallairborneparticles containing the virus. Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing.    Transmission is more likely the more physically close people are. However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.  The transmission of the virus is carried out through virus-laden fluid particles, or droplets, which are created in the respiratory tract, and they are expelled by the mouth and the nose. There are three types of transmission: “droplet” and “contact”, which are associated with large droplets, and “airborne”, which is associated with small droplets. If the droplets are above a certain critical size, they settle faster than theyevaporate, and therefore theycontaminatesurfaces surrounding them. Droplets that are below a certain critical size, evaporate faster than they settle; Due to that fact, they formnucleithat remain airborne for an extensive amount of time over extensive distances. Infectivitycan begin four to five days before the onset of symptoms, although contact tracing typically begins only two to three days before symptom onset. Infected people can spread the disease even if they are pre-symptomatic orasymptomatic. Most commonly, the peak viral load inupper respiratory tractsamples occurs close to the time of symptom onset and declines after the first week after symptoms begin. Current evidence suggests a duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness of up to ten days following symptom onset for people with mild to moderate COVID-19, and up to 20 days for persons with severe COVID-19, including immunocompromised people.  Infectious particles range in size fromaerosolsthat remain suspended in the air for long periods of time to largerdropletsthat remain airborne briefly or fall to the ground.    Additionally, COVID-19 research has redefined the traditional understanding of how respiratory viruses are transmitted.  The largest droplets of respiratory fluid do not travel far, but can be inhaled or land on mucous membranes on the eyes, nose, or mouth to infect. Aerosols are highest in concentration when people are in close proximity, which leads to easier viral transmission when people are physically close,   butairborne transmissioncan occur at longer distances, mainly in locations that are poorly ventilated; in those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.  VirologyMain article:SARS-CoV-2Illustration ofSARSr-CoVvirionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) is anovelsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to theclusterof acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in relatedcoronavirusesin nature, particularly inRhinolophus sinicusaka Chinese horseshoe bats. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap which bursts itsprotective bubble. Hospital disinfectants, alcohols, heat,povidone-iodine, andultraviolet-C(UV-C) irradiation are also effective disinfection methods for surfaces. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the originalSARS-CoV. It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genusBetacoronavirus, in subgenusSarbecovirus(lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the wholegenomelevel to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCovRaTG13).   The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 includemembrane glycoprotein(M),envelope protein(E),nucleocapsid protein(N), and thespike protein(S). The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is about 98% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains around 98% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only around 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 variantsMain article:Variants of SARS-CoV-2The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into eithercladesorlineages.  The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages byGISAID,NextstrainandPango. The expert group convened by the WHO recommended the labelling of variants using letters of theGreek alphabet, for example,Alpha,Beta,Delta, andGamma, giving the justification that they \"will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences.\" Nextstraindivides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), whileGISAIDdivides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR). The Pango tool groups variants intolineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage.  Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged throughout 2020.  Cluster 5emerged amongminksand mink farmers inDenmark. After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, the cluster was assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in Denmark as of 1 February 2021. As of December\\xa02021[update], there are five dominant variants of SARS-CoV-2 spreading among global populations: theAlpha variant(B.1.1.7, formerly called the UK variant), first found in London and Kent, theBeta variant(B.1.351, formerly called the South Africa variant), theGamma variant(P.1, formerly called the Brazil variant), theDelta variant(B.1.617.2, formerly called the India variant), and theOmicron variant(B.1.1.529), which had spread to 57 countries as of 7 December.  PathophysiologyCOVID‑19pathogenesisThe SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. COVID‑19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs). The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via thereceptorfor the enzymeangiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface oftype II alveolar cellsof the lungs. The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell. Respiratory tractFollowing viral entry, COVID‑19 infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways. Nervous systemOne common symptom, loss of smell, results frominfection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to theolfactory neurons. The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in COVID‑19 has been reported in many medical publications. It is clear that many people withCOVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in thecentral nervous system(CNS) of the majority of COVID-19 patients withneurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed. While virus has been detected incerebrospinal fluidof autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.   The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood–brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell. Tropismandmultiple organ injuriesin SARS-CoV-2 infectionResearch conducted when Alpha was the dominant variant has suggested COVID-19 may cause brain damage. It is unknown if such damage is temporary or permanent, and whether Omicron has similar effects.  Observed individuals infected with COVID-19 (most with mild cases) experienced an additional 0.2% to 2% of brain tissue lost in regions of the brain connected to the sense of smell compared with uninfected individuals, and the overall effect on the brain was equivalent on average to at least one extra year of normal ageing; infected individuals also scored lower on several cognitive tests. All effects were more pronounced among older ages. Gastrointestinal tractThe virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in theglandularcells ofgastric,duodenalandrectalepithelium as well asendothelialcells andenterocytesof thesmall intestine. Cardiovascular systemThe virus can causeacute myocardial injuryand chronic damage to thecardiovascular system.  An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease. Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart. ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.  A high incidence ofthrombosisandvenous thromboembolismoccurs in people transferred tointensive care unitswith COVID‑19 infections, and may be related to poor prognosis. Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by highD-dimerlevels caused by blood clots) may have a significant role in mortality, incidents of clots leading topulmonary embolisms, andischaemic events(strokes) within the brain found as complications leading to death in people infected with COVID‑19. Infection may initiate a chain ofvasoconstrictive responseswithin the body, including pulmonary vasoconstriction – a possible mechanism in which oxygenation decreases during pneumonia. Furthermore, damage ofarteriolesandcapillarieswas found in brain tissue samples of people who died from COVID‑19.  COVID‑19 may also cause substantial structural changes toblood cells, sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge. A low level of blood lymphocytesmay result from the virus acting through ACE2-related entry into lymphocytes. Other organsAnother common cause of death is complications related to thekidneys. Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalised patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems. Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have founddiffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung. ImmunopathologyKey components of theadaptive immune responseto SARS-CoV-2Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevatedIL‑2,IL‑7,IL‑6,granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor(GM‑CSF),interferon gamma-induced protein10(IP‑10),monocyte chemoattractant protein1(MCP1),macrophage inflammatory protein 1‑alpha(MIP‑1‑alpha), andtumour necrosis factor(TNF‑α) indicative ofcytokine release syndrome(CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology. Interferon alphaplays a complex, Janus-faced role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Although it promotes the elimination of virus-infected cells, it also upregulates the expression of ACE-2, thereby facilitating the SARS-Cov2 virus to enter cells and to replicate.  A competition of negative feedback loops (via protective effects of interferon alpha) and positive feedback loops (via upregulation of ACE-2) is assumed to determine the fate of patients suffering from COVID-19. Additionally, people with COVID‑19 andacute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) have classicalserumbiomarkersof CRS, including elevatedC-reactive protein(CRP),lactate dehydrogenase(LDH),D-dimer, andferritin. Systemic inflammation results invasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secretingT\\xa0cellswere shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secretingmonocytesand severe lung pathology in people with COVID‑19. Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy. Viral and host factorsVirus proteinsThe association between SARS-CoV-2 and theRenin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System(RAAS)Multiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus. The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via theACE2receptors. It includes two subunits: S1 and S2. S1 determines the virus-host range and cellular tropism via the receptor-binding domain. S2 mediates the membrane fusion of the virus to its potential cell host via the H1 and HR2, which areheptad repeatregions. Studies have shown that S1 domain inducedIgGandIgAantibody levels at a much higher capacity. It is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective COVID‑19 vaccines. The M protein is the viral protein responsible for the transmembrane transport of nutrients. It is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope. The N and E protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the host\\'s immune response. Host factorsHumanangiotensin converting enzyme 2(hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-CoV-2 virus targets causing COVID‑19. Theoretically, the usage ofangiotensin receptor blockers(ARB) andACE inhibitorsupregulating ACE2 expression might increasemorbiditywith COVID‑19, though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of ARB; however no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes. Until further data is available, guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain. The effect of the virus on ACE2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration, increased blood vessel permeability, alveolar wall permeability, as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants. These effects cause the majority of the respiratory symptoms. However, the aggravation of local inflammation causes a cytokine storm eventually leading to asystemic inflammatory response syndrome. Among healthy adults not exposed to SARS-CoV-2, about 35% haveCD4+T cellsthat recognise the SARS-CoV-2S protein(particularly the S2 subunit) and about 50% react to other proteins of the virus, suggestingcross-reactivityfrom previouscommon coldscaused by other coronaviruses. It is unknown whether different persons use similar antibody genes in response to COVID‑19. Host cytokine responseMild versus severeimmune responseduringvirus infectionThe severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as thecytokine storm. Levels ofinterleukin1B,interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein1 were all associated with COVID‑19 disease severity. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes ofmorbidityand mortality in COVID‑19 disease. A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID‑19, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality. The storm causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, blood clotting events such as strokes, myocardial infarction,encephalitis,acute kidney injury, andvasculitis. The production ofIL-1,IL-2,IL-6,TNF-alpha, andinterferon-gamma, all crucial components of normal immune responses, inadvertently become the causes of a cytokine storm. The cells of thecentral nervous system, themicroglia,neurons, andastrocytes, are also involved in the release ofpro-inflammatory cytokinesaffecting the nervous system, and effects of cytokine storms toward theCNSare not uncommon. Pregnancy responseThere are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that they are prone to have complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures. Physiological responses to pregnancy can include:Immunological: The immunological response to COVID-19, like other viruses, depends on a working immune system. It adapts during pregnancy to allow the development of the foetus whose genetic load is only partially shared with their mother, leading to a different immunological reaction to infections during the course of pregnancy. Respiratory: Many factors can make pregnant women more vulnerable to hard respiratory infections. One of them is the total reduction of the lungs\\' capacity and inability to clear secretions. Coagulation: During pregnancy, there are higher levels of circulating coagulation factors, and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be implicated. The thromboembolic events with associated mortality are a risk for pregnant women. However, from the evidence base, it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of grave consequences of this virus. In addition to the above, other clinical studies have proved that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the period of pregnancy in different ways. On the one hand, there is little evidence of its impact up to 12 weeks gestation. On the other hand, COVID-19 infection may cause increased rates of unfavourable outcomes in the course of the pregnancy. Some examples of these could be foetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, which refers to the foetal death past 22 or 28 completed weeks of pregnancy as well as the death among live-born children up to seven completed days of life. For preterm birth, a 2023 review indicates that there appears to be a correlation with COVID-19. Unvaccinated women in later stages of pregnancy with COVID-19 are more likely than other patients to need very intensive care. Babies born to mothers with COVID-19 are more likely to have breathing problems. Pregnant women are strongly encouraged to getvaccinated. DiagnosisFurther information:COVID-19 testingCOVID‑19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed usingreverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) or othernucleic acidtesting of infected secretions.  Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection. Detection of a past infection is possible withserological tests, which detectantibodiesproduced by the body in response to the infection. Viral testingMain article:COVID-19 testingDemonstration of anasopharyngeal swabforCOVID‑19 testingThe standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 arenucleic acid tests,  which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.\" The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by anasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.  Results are generally available within hours. The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease. Several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. Several have been evaluated byPublic Health Englandand approved for use in the UK. TheUniversity of Oxford\\'s CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence  that \"a good proportion of \\'new\\' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\" and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\" In September 2020, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\". ImagingACTscan of a person with COVID-19 shows lesions (bright regions) in the lungsCT scan of rapid progression stage of COVID-19Chest X-ray showing COVID‑19 pneumoniaChest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening.  Bilateral multilobarground-glass opacitieswith a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection.  Subpleural dominance,crazy paving(lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), andconsolidationmay appear as the disease progresses.  Characteristic imaging features on chestradiographsandcomputed tomography(CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities withoutpleural effusions. Many groups have createdCOVID‑19 datasetsthat include imagery such as theItalian Radiological Societywhich has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases. Due to overlap with other infections such asadenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limitedspecificityin identifying COVID‑19. A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and moresensitive. CodingIn late 2019, the WHO assigned emergencyICD-10disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID‑19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

PreventionFurther information:COVID‑19 vaccine,Workplace hazard controls for COVID‑19,Pandemic prevention,Non-pharmaceutical intervention,Preparations prior to COVID-19,COVID-19 surveillance, andCOVID-19 appsWithout pandemic containment measures\\xa0– such as social distancing, vaccination, and face masks\\xa0– pathogens can spread exponentially. This graphic shows how early adoption of containment measures tends to protect wider swaths of the population.Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.  Those diagnosed with COVID‑19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider,wear a face maskbefore entering the healthcare provider\\'s office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.  The firstCOVID‑19 vaccinewas granted regulatory approval on 2December 2020 by the UK medicines regulatorMHRA. It was evaluated foremergency use authorisation(EUA) status by the USFDA, and in several other countries. Initially, the USNational Institutes of Healthguidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID‑19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial.  Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID‑19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as \"flattening thecurve\". This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of active cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available.  VaccineMain article:COVID-19 vaccineDifferent vaccine candidate types in development for SARS-CoV-2A COVID‑19 vaccine is avaccineintended to provideacquired immunityagainst severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19).Face masks and respiratory hygieneMain article:Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemicMasks with an exhalation valve. The valves are a weak point that can transmit the viruses outwards.The WHO and the US CDC recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.  This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.  Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.  A face covering without vents or holes will also filter out particles containing the virus from inhaled and exhaled air, reducing the chances of infection. However, if the mask includes anexhalation valve, a wearer that is infected (and possibly asymptomatic) may transmit the virus through the valve. Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus. Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease. When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available. Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged. Healthcare professionals interacting directly with people who have COVID‑19 are advised to userespiratorsat least as protective asNIOSH-certifiedN95or equivalent, in addition to otherpersonal protective equipment. Indoor ventilation and avoiding crowded indoor spacesThe CDC recommends that crowded indoor spaces should be avoided. When indoors, increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air can reduce transmission.  The WHO recommendsventilationandair filtrationin public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols.   Exhaled respiratory particles can build-up within enclosed spaces with inadequateventilation. The risk of COVID‑19 infection increases especially in spaces where people engage in physical exertion or raise their voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing) as this increases exhalation of respiratory droplets. Prolonged exposure to these conditions, typically more than 15 minutes, leads to higher risk of infection. Displacement ventilationwith large natural inlets can move stale air directly to the exhaust inlaminar flowwhile significantly reducing the concentration of droplets and particles.Passive ventilationreduces energy consumption and maintenance costs but may lackcontrollabilityandheat recovery. Displacement ventilation can also be achieved mechanically with higher energy and maintenance costs. The use of large ducts and openings helps to prevent mixing in closed environments. Recirculation and mixing should be avoided because recirculation prevents dilution of harmful particles and redistributes possibly contaminated air, and mixing increases the concentration and range of infectious particles and keeps larger particles in the air. Hand-washing and hygieneMain article:Hand washingStudents inRwandahand washing and wearing face masks during theCOVID‑19 pandemic in the country.Thorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required. The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one\\'s nose. When soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-basedhand sanitiserwith at least 60% alcohol. For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production. In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises fromethanolorisopropanol.Hydrogen peroxideis used to help eliminatebacterial sporesin the alcohol; it is \"not an active substance for handantisepsis.\"Glycerolis added as ahumectant. Social distancingMain article:Social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemicSocial distancing (also known as physical distancing) includesinfection controlactions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others. Many governments are mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak. Outbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing.  In the United States, the prisoner population is ageing and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID‑19 due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease, and poor access to high-quality healthcare. Surface cleaningAfter being expelled from the body, coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days. If a person touches the dirty surface, they may deposit the virus at the eyes, nose, or mouth where it can enter the body and cause infection. Evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of COVID‑19,   leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase ofantimicrobial resistancethrough the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes.  Deep cleaningand other surface sanitation has been criticised ashygiene theatre, giving a false sense of security against something primarily spread through the air.  The amount of time that the virus can survive depends significantly on the type of surface, the temperature, and the humidity. Coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to theUV lightinsunlight. Like other enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV-2 survives longest when the temperature is atroom temperatureor lower, and when therelative humidityis low (<50%). On many surfaces, including glass, some types of plastic, stainless steel, and skin, the virus can remain infective for several days indoors at room temperature, or even about a week under ideal conditions.  On some surfaces, including cotton fabric and copper, the virus usually dies after a few hours. The virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on non-porous surfaces due to capillary action within pores and faster aerosol droplet evaporation.   However, of the many surfaces tested, two with the longest survival times are N95 respirator masks and surgical masks, both of which are considered porous surfaces. The CDC says that in most situations, cleaning surfaces with soap or detergent, not disinfecting, is enough to reduce risk of transmission.  The CDC recommends that if a COVID‑19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by the ill persons should be disinfected. Surfaces may be decontaminated with 62–71 per centethanol, 50–100 per cent isopropanol, 0.1 per centsodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent hydrogen peroxide, 0.2–7.5 per centpovidone-iodine, or 50–200 ppmhypochlorous acid. Other solutions, such asbenzalkonium chlorideandchlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.Ultraviolet germicidal irradiationmay also be used, although popular devices require5–10\\xa0minexposure and may deteriorate some materials over time. A datasheet comprising the authorised substances to disinfection in the food industry (including suspension or surface tested, kind of surface, use dilution, disinfectant and inoculum volumes) can be seen in the supplementary material of. Self-isolationSelf-isolationat home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID‑19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups. Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID‑19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure. International travel-related control measuresA 2021 Cochrane rapid review found that based upon low-certainty evidence, international travel-related control measures such as restricting cross-border travel may help to contain the spread of COVID‑19. Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases. While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up. The review concluded that a minimum 10-day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID‑19 and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening. TreatmentMain article:Treatment and management of COVID-19An overview of COVID-19 therapeutics and drugsAlthough several medications have been approved in different countries as of April 2022, not all countries have these medications. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms who are in the risk groups can takenirmatrelvir/ritonavir(marketed as Paxlovid) orremdesivir, either of which reduces the risk of serious illness or hospitalization. In the US, theBiden Administration COVID-19 action planincludes the Test to Treat initiative, where people can go to a pharmacy, take a COVID test, and immediately receive free Paxlovid if they test positive. Highly effective vaccines have reduced mortality related to SARS-CoV-2; however, for those awaiting vaccination, as well as for the estimated millions of immunocompromised persons who are unlikely to respond robustly to vaccination, treatment remains important. The cornerstone ofmanagement of COVID-19has beensupportive care, which includes treatment torelieve symptoms,fluid therapy,oxygen supportandprone positioningas needed, and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs.   Most cases of COVID-19 are mild. In these, supportive care includes medication such asparacetamolorNSAIDsto relieve symptoms (fever, body aches, cough), proper intake of fluids, rest, andnasal breathing.    Good personal hygiene and ahealthy dietare also recommended. As of April 2020 the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) recommended that those who suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at home and wear a face mask. As of November 2020 use of theglucocorticoiddexamethasonehad been strongly recommended in those severe cases treated in hospital with low oxygen levels, to reduce the risk of death.   Noninvasive ventilationand, ultimately, admission to anintensive care unitformechanical ventilationmay be required to support breathing. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) has been used to address  respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.  Some of the cases of severe disease course are caused by systemic hyper-inflammation, the so-calledcytokine storm. Prognosis and risk factorsSee also:COVID-19 pandemic death rates by countryThe severity of COVID‑19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as thecommon cold. In 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalisation. Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks. The ItalianIstituto Superiore di Sanitàreported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being hospitalised. However, people transferred to an ICU had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death. Abnormal sodium levels during hospitalisation with COVID-19 are associated with poor prognoses: high sodium with a greater risk of death, and low sodium with an increased chance of needing ventilator support.  Prolongedprothrombintime and elevatedC-reactive proteinlevels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID‑19 and with a transfer to ICU.  Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID‑19 will experiencesymptoms lasting longer than a month.  A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath. On 30 October 2020, WHO chiefTedros Adhanomwarned that \"to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects.\" He has described the vast spectrum of COVID‑19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as \"really concerning\". They range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs\\xa0– including the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic effects. Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body. Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms. Tedros therefore concluded that a strategy of achievingherd immunityby infection, rather than vaccination, is \"morally unconscionable and unfeasible\". In terms of hospital readmissions about 9% of 106,000 individuals had to return for hospital treatment within two months of discharge. The average to readmit was eight days since first hospital visit. There are several risk factors that have been identified as being a cause of multiple admissions to a hospital facility. Among these are advanced age (above 65 years of age) and presence of a chronic condition such as diabetes, COPD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease.  According toscientific reviewssmokers are more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.  Acting on the same ACE2 pulmonary receptors affected by smoking, air pollution has been correlated with the disease. Short term and chronic exposure to air pollution seems to enhance morbidity and mortality from COVID‑19.   Pre-existing heart and lung diseases and alsoobesity, especially in conjunction withfatty liver disease, contributes to an increased health risk of COVID‑19.    It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2. One research study that looked into the COVID‑19 infections in hospitalised kidney transplant recipients found a mortality rate of 11%. Men with untreatedhypogonadismwere 2.4 times more likely than men with eugonadism to be hospitalised if they contracted COVID-19; Hypogonad men treated withtestosteronewere less likely to be hospitalised for COVID-19 than men who were not treated for hypogonadism. Genetic risk factorsGeneticsplays an important role in the ability to fight off Covid. For instance, those that do not produce detectabletype I interferonsor produceauto-antibodiesagainst these may get much sicker from COVID‑19.  Genetic screeningis able to detect interferon effector genes. Some genetic variants are risk factors in specific populations. For instance, andalleleof theDOCK2gene (dedicator of cytokinesis 2 gene) is a common risk factor in Asian populations but much less common in Europe. The mutation leads to lower expression of DOCK2 especially in younger patients with severe Covid. In fact, many other genes and genetic variants have been found that determine the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections. ChildrenSee also:Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on childrenWhile very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole.  Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults. The CDC reports that in the US roughly a third of hospitalised children were admitted to the ICU, while a European multinational study of hospitalised children from June 2020, found that about 8% of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care. Four of the 582 children (0.7%) in the European study died, but the actual mortality rate may be \"substantially lower\" since milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study.  Longer-term effectsFurther information:Long COVIDSome early studies suggest that 10–20% of people with COVID‑19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month.  A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems, including fatigue and shortness of breath. About 5–10% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. By a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID‑19. In people requiring hospital admission, up to 98% of CT scans performed show lung abnormalities after 28 days of illness even if they had clinically improved. People with advanced age, severe disease, prolonged ICU stays, or who smoke are more likely to have long-lasting effects, including pulmonary fibrosis. Overall, approximately one-third of those investigated after four weeks will have findings ofpulmonary fibrosisor reduced lung function as measured byDLCO, even in asymptomatic people, but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more time. After severe disease, lung function can take anywhere from three months to a year or more to return to previous levels. The risks ofcognitive deficit,dementia, psychotic disorders, andepilepsyor seizures persists at an increased level two years after infection. ImmunitySee also:COVID-19 vaccineHumanantibody responseto SARS-CoV-2 infectionTheimmune responseby humans to SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of thecell-mediated immunityand antibody production, just as with most other infections. B cells interact with T cells and begin dividing before selection into the plasma cell, partly on the basis of their affinity for antigen. Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains unknown if theimmunityis long-lasting in people who recover from the disease. The presence of neutralising antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection, but the level of neutralising antibody declines with time. Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralising antibody two months after infection. In another study, the level of neutralising antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms. However, the lack of antibodies in the blood does not mean antibodies will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to SARS-CoV-2. Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms. As of August 2021, reinfection with COVID‑19 was possible but uncommon. The first case of reinfection was documented in August 2020. A systematic review found 17 cases of confirmed reinfection in medical literature as of May 2021. With theOmicron variant, as of 2022, reinfections have become common, albeit it is unclear how common. COVID-19 reinfectionsare thought to likely be less severe than primary infections, especially if one was previously infected by the same variant. [additional citation(s) needed]MortalityMain articles:COVID-19 pandemicandCOVID-19 pandemic death rates by countrySeveral measures are commonly used to quantify mortality. These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health. Themortality ratereflects the number of deaths within a specific demographic group divided by the population of that demographic group. Consequently, the mortality rate reflects the prevalence as well as the severity of the disease within a given population. Mortality rates are highly correlated to age, with relatively low rates for young people and relatively high rates among the elderly.   In fact, one relevant factor of mortality rates is the age structure of the countries\\' populations. For example, the case fatality rate for COVID‑19 is lower in India than in the US since India\\'s younger population represents a larger percentage than in the US. Case fatality rateThecase fatality rate(CFR) reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is1.02% (6,881,955/676,609,955) as of 10 March 2023. The number varies by region.  Total confirmed cases over timeTotal confirmed cases of COVID‑19 per million people Total confirmed deaths over timeTotal confirmed deaths due to COVID‑19 per million people Infection fatality rateA key metric in gauging the severity of COVID‑19 is theinfection fatality rate(IFR), also referred to as theinfection fatality ratioorinfection fatality risk.   This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to theCFR, the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases. EstimatesThe red line shows the estimate of infection fatality rate (IFR), in percentage terms, as a function of age. The shaded region depicts the 95% confidence interval for that estimate. Markers denotes specific observations used in the meta-analysis. The same relationship plotted on a log scaleA December 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that population IFR during the first wave of the pandemic was about 0.5% to 1% in many locations (including France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), 1% to 2% in other locations (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and exceeded 2% in Italy. That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. These results were also highlighted in a December 2020 report issued by the WHO. IFR estimate per age group(to December 2020) Age groupIFR0–340.004%35–440.068%45–540.23%55–640.75%65–742.5%75–848.5%85\\u2009+28.3%An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID‑19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualised risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonalinfluenza. Earlier estimates of IFRAt an early stage of the pandemic, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between 0.3% and 1%.  On 2July, The WHO\\'s chief scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6%.  In August, the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%. Firm lower limits of IFRs have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot be less than the population fatality rate. (After sufficient time however, people can get reinfected). As of 10 July, in New York City, with a population of 8.4\\xa0million, 23,377 individuals (18,758 confirmed and 4,619 probable) have died with COVID‑19 (0.3% of the population). Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of ≈0.9%, and ≈1.4%. InBergamo province, 0.6% of the population has died. In September 2020, the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) reported preliminary estimates of age-specific IFRs for public health planning purposes.

However, in a few countries like India, Nepal, Vietnam, and Slovenia the fatality cases are higher in women than men. Globally, men are more likely to be admitted to theICUand more likely to die.  One meta-analysis found that globally, men were more likely to get COVID‑19 than women; there were approximately 55 men and 45 women per 100 infections (CI: 51.43–56.58). TheChinese Center for Disease Control and Preventionreported the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women. Later reviews in June 2020 indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in CFR between genders.  One review acknowledges the different mortality rates in Chinese men, suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors. Smoking, which in some countries like China is mainly a male activity, is a habit that contributes to increasing significantly the case fatality rates among men. Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men. In Europe as of February 2020, 57% of the infected people were men and 72% of those died with COVID‑19 were men. As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID‑19 infections. Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently. Ethnic differencesIn the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID‑19 have occurred among African Americans and other minority groups. Structural factors that prevent them from practising social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in \"essential\" occupations such as retail grocery workers, public transit employees, health-care workers and custodial staff. Greater prevalence of lackinghealth insuranceand care of underlying conditions such asdiabetes, hypertension, andheart diseasealso increase their risk of death. Similar issues affectNative AmericanandLatinocommunities. On the one hand, in the Dominican Republic there is a clear example of both gender and ethnic inequality. In this Latin American territory, there is great inequality and precariousness that especially affects Dominican women, with greater emphasis on those of Haitian descent. According to a US health policy non-profit, 34% of American Indian and Alaska Native People (AIAN) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly adults. The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water. Leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities. In the UK, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID‑19 have occurred in those of aBlack,Asian, and other ethnic minority background.   More severe impacts upon patients including the relative incidence of the necessity of hospitalisation requirements, and vulnerability to the disease has been associated via DNA analysis to be expressed in genetic variants at chromosomal region 3, features that are associated with EuropeanNeanderthalheritage. That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease. The findings are from Professor Svante Pääbo and researchers he leads at theMax Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropologyand theKarolinska Institutet. This admixture of modern human and Neanderthal genes is estimated to have occurred roughly between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago in Southern Europe. ComorbiditiesBiologicalfactors (immune response) and the general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID‑19. Most of those who die of COVID‑19 havepre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension,diabetes mellitus, andcardiovascular disease. According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions. The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths wheremedical chartswere available, 96.1% of people had at least onecomorbiditywith the average person having 3.4 diseases. According to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension (66% of deaths),type\\xa02 diabetes(29.8% of deaths),ischaemic heart disease(27.6% of deaths),atrial fibrillation(23.1% of deaths) andchronic renal failure(20.2% of deaths).Most critical respiratory comorbidities according to the USCenters for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), are: moderate or severeasthma, pre-existingCOPD,pulmonary fibrosis,cystic fibrosis. Evidence stemming frommeta-analysisof several smaller research papers also suggests that smoking can be associated with worse outcomes.  When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. COVID‑19 also poses a greater risk to people whomisuse opioidsandamphetamines, insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage. In August 2020, the CDC issued a caution thattuberculosis(TB) infections could increase the risk of severe illness or death. The WHO recommended that people with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for COVID‑19 could not rule out co-infections. Some projections have estimated that reduced TB detection due to the pandemic could result in 6.3\\xa0million additional TB cases and 1.4\\xa0million TB-related deaths by 2025.

A joint-study conducted in early 2021 by the People\\'s Republic of China and theWorld Health Organizationindicated that the virus descended from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and likely spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host. There are several theories about where theindex caseoriginated andinvestigations into the origin of the pandemicare ongoing. According to articles published in July 2022 inScience, virus transmission into humans occurred through two spillover events in November 2019 and was likely due to live wildlife trade on theHuanan wet marketin the city ofWuhan(Hubei, China).   Doubts about the conclusions have mostly centered on the precise site of spillover. Earlierphylogeneticsestimated that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019.   A phylogenetic algorithm analysis suggested that the virus may have been circulating inGuangdongbefore Wuhan. Most scientists believe the virus spilled into human populations through naturalzoonosis, similar to theSARS-CoV-1andMERS-CoVoutbreaks, and consistent with other pandemics in human history.  According to theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeseveral social and environmental factors includingclimate change,natural ecosystem destructionandwildlife tradeincreased the likelihood of suchzoonotic spillover.  One study made with the support of theEuropean Unionfoundclimate changeincreased the likelihood of the pandemic by influencing distribution of bat species.  Available evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was originally harboured by bats, and spread to humans multiple times from infected wild animals at theHuanan Seafood MarketinWuhanin December 2019.  A minority of scientists and some members of theU.S intelligence communitybelieve the virus may have beenunintentionally leakedfrom a laboratory such as theWuhan Institute of Virology.  The US intelligence community has mixed views on the issue,  but overall agrees with the scientific consensus that the virus was not developed as abiological weaponand is unlikely to have beengenetically engineered.    There is no evidence SARS-CoV-2 existed in any laboratory prior to the pandemic.   The first confirmed human infections were in Wuhan. A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID‑19, published in January 2020 inThe Lancet, reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1December 2019.   Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8December 2019. Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20 January 2020.  According to official Chinese sources, these were mostly linked to theHuanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals. In May 2020,George Gao, the director of the CDC, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating that the market was the site of an earlysuperspreading event, but that it was not the site of the initial outbreak. Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater samples that were collected inMilanandTurin, Italy, on 18 December 2019. By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.  The number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 December, and at least 266 by 31 December. On 24 December,Wuhan Central Hospitalsent abronchoalveolar lavage fluid(BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus. A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctorZhang Jixianin Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December. On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result forSARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on \"the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause\" that same evening. Eight of these doctors, includingLi Wenliang(punished on 3January), were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours and another,Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on 31 December, confirming 27 cases   – enough to trigger an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days. In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to otherChinese provinces, helped by theChinese New Year migrationand Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange. On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one inShenzhen. Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then, and more may have been infected. A report inThe Lanceton 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its \"pandemic potential\".  On 30 January, the WHO declared COVID-19 aPublic Health Emergency of International Concern. By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times. Italy had its first confirmed cases on 31 January 2020, two tourists from China. Italy overtook China as the country with the most deaths on 19 March 2020. By 26 March the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases inNew Yorkcame from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country. Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019,  and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6February 2020. RT-PCR testing of untreated wastewater samples from Brazil and Italy have suggested detection of SARS-CoV-2 as early as November and December 2019, respectively, but the methods of such sewage studies have not been optimised, many have not been peer-reviewed, details are often missing, and there is a risk of false positives due to contamination or if only one gene target is detected. A September 2020 review journal article said, \"The possibility that the COVID‑19 infection had already spread to Europe at the end of last year is now indicated by abundant, even if partially circumstantial, evidence,\" including pneumonia case numbers and radiology in France and Italy in November and December. As of 1\\xa0October\\xa02021[update],Reutersreported that it had estimated the worldwide total number of deaths due to COVID‑19 to have exceeded five million. MisinformationMain article:COVID-19 misinformationAfter the initial outbreak of COVID‑19,misinformationanddisinformationregarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online.   In September 2020, the USCenters for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) published preliminary estimates of the risk of death by age groups in the United States, but those estimates were widely misreported and misunderstood.  Other speciesSee also:Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on animalsHumans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals,  a type of disease transmission referred to aszooanthroponosis.  Some pets, especially cats andferrets, can catch this virus from infected humans.  Symptoms in cats includerespiratory(such as a cough) and digestive symptoms. Cats can spread the virus to other cats, and may be able to spread the virus to humans, but cat-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been proven.  Compared to cats, dogs are less susceptible to this infection. Behaviours which increase the risk of transmission include kissing, licking, and petting the animal. The virus does not appear to be able to infectpigs,ducks, or chickens at all. Mice, rats, and rabbits, if they can be infected at all, are unlikely to be involved in spreading the virus. Tigers and lions in zoos have become infected as a result of contact with infected humans. As expected, monkeys andgreat apespecies such asorangutanscan also be infected with the COVID‑19 virus. Minks, which are in thesame familyas ferrets, have been infected. Minks may be asymptomatic, and can also spread the virus to humans. Multiple countries have identified infected animals inmink farms. Denmark, a major producer of mink pelts, ordered the slaughter of all minks over fears of viral mutations, following an outbreak referred to asCluster 5. A vaccine for mink and other animals is being researched. ResearchFurther information:COVID-19 drug developmentInternational research on vaccines and medicines in COVID‑19 is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers.  The CDC has classified it to require aBSL3grade laboratory. There has been a great deal of COVID‑19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand. As of December\\xa02020[update], hundreds ofclinical trialshave been undertaken, with research happening on every continent exceptAntarctica. As of November\\xa02020[update], more than 200 possible treatments have been studied in humans. Transmission and prevention researchFurther information:COVID-19 vaccineModellingresearch has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of transmission, diagnosis and prognosis of infection, estimation of the impact of interventions,  or allocation of resources. Modelling studies are mostly based oncompartmental models in epidemiology, estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions. Several other types of models have been developed and used during the COVID‑19 pandemic includingcomputational fluid dynamicsmodels to study the flow physics of COVID‑19, retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant exposure, mobility-data based models to investigate transmission, or the use ofmacroeconomicmodels to assess the economic impact of the pandemic. Treatment-related researchMain article:COVID-19 drug repurposing researchSeven possible drug targets in viral replication process and drugsRepurposedantiviral drugsmake up most of the research into COVID‑19 treatments.  Other candidates in trials includevasodilators,corticosteroids, immune therapies,lipoic acid,bevacizumab, andrecombinantangiotensin-converting enzyme 2. In March 2020, theWorld Health Organization(WHO) initiated theSolidarity trialto assess the treatment effects of some promising drugs: anexperimental drugcalled remdesivir;anti-malarialdrugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; twoanti-HIV drugs,lopinavir/ritonavir; andinterferon-beta.  More than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of April 2020. Research on the antimalarial drugshydroxychloroquineandchloroquineshowed that they were ineffective at best,  and that they may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir. By May 2020[update], France, Italy, and Belgium had banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID‑19 treatment. In June, initial results from the randomisedRECOVERY Trialin the United Kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one third for people who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental oxygen. Because this is a well-tested and widely available treatment, it was welcomed by the WHO, which is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone and other steroids.  Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the NIH for patients with COVID‑19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID‑19 who do not require supplemental oxygen. In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID‑19.  The WHO recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and critical COVID‑19 (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence). The WHO suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with non-severe COVID‑19 (conditional recommendation, based on low certainty evidence). The updated guidance was based on a meta-analysis of clinical trials of critically ill COVID‑19 patients.  In September 2020, theEuropean Medicines Agency(EMA) endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents from twelve years of age and weighing at least 40 kilograms (88\\xa0lb) who require supplemental oxygen therapy.  Dexamethasone can be takenby mouthor given as an injection orinfusion (drip) into a vein. In November 2020, the USFood and Drug Administration(FDA) issued an emergency use authorisation for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapybamlanivimabfor the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID‑19. Bamlanivimab is authorised for people with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing who are twelve years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (88\\xa0lb), and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID‑19 or hospitalisation. This includes those who are 65 years of age or older, or who have chronic medical conditions. In February 2021, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation (EUA) for bamlanivimab andetesevimabadministered together for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID‑19 in people twelve years of age or older weighing at least 40 kilograms (88\\xa0lb) who test positive for SARS‑CoV‑2 and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID‑19. The authorised use includes treatment for those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions. In April 2021, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorisation (EUA) that allowed for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab, when administered alone, to be used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID‑19 in adults and certain paediatric patients. Cytokine stormVarious therapeutic strategies for targeting cytokine stormAcytokine stormcan be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID‑19. A cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction where a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines andchemokinesare released too quickly. A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure. Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID‑19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses. These high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a cytokine storm. Tocilizumabhas been included in treatment guidelines by China\\'sNational Health Commissionafter a small study was completed.  It is undergoing aPhaseIInon-randomised trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.  Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people. Theinterleukin-6 receptor(IL-6R)antagonistwas approved by the FDA to undergo a PhaseIII clinical trial assessing its effectiveness on COVID‑19 based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause,CAR T celltherapy, in 2017. There is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS. Prophylactic tocilizumab has been shown to increase serum IL-6 levels by saturating the IL-6R, driving IL-6 across theblood–brain barrier, and exacerbatingneurotoxicitywhile having no effect on the incidence of CRS. Lenzilumab, an anti-GM-CSFmonoclonal antibody, is protective in murine models for CAR T cell-induced CRS and neurotoxicity and is a viable therapeutic option due to the observed increase of pathogenic GM-CSF secreting Tcells in hospitalised patients with COVID‑19. Passive antibodiesOverview of the application and use ofconvalescent plasmatherapyTransferring purified and concentratedantibodiesproduced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID‑19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method ofpassive immunisation.  [needs update]Viral neutralisationis the anticipatedmechanism of actionby which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralising antibodies. As of 8August 2020, eight neutralising antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies. It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID‑19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections. Other mechanisms, however, such asantibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicityorphagocytosis, may be possible. Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development. The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID‑19 is also being studied. This involves the production ofconvalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to this virus, which is then administered to active patients. This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results. An updated Cochrane review in May 2021 found high certainty evidence that, for the treatment of people with moderate to severe COVID‑19, convalescent plasma did not reduce mortality or bring about symptom improvement. There continues to be uncertainty about the safety of convalescent plasma administration to people with COVID‑19 and differing outcomes measured in different studies limits their use in determining efficacy. BioethicsSince the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic, scholars have explored thebioethics,normative economics, andpolitical theoriesofhealthcare policiesrelated to the public health crisis. Academics have pointed to the moral distress of healthcare workers, ethics of distributing scarce healthcare resources such as ventilators, and the global justice of vaccine diplomacies.[citation needed]The socio-economic inequalities between genders, races, groups with disabilities, communities, regions, countries, and continents have also drawn attention in academia and the general public.Effects on other diseasesThe use ofsocial distancingand the wearing ofsurgical masksand similar precautions against COVID‑19 may have caused a drop in the spread of thecommon coldand theflu.

The first known case wasidentified in Wuhan, China, in December .The disease quickly spread worldwide, resulting in theCOVID- pandemic.Thesymptoms of COVID‑are variable but often include fever,cough, headache,fatigue,breathing difficulties,loss of smell, andloss of taste.Symptoms may begin one to fourteen daysafter exposureto the virus. At least a third of people who are infecteddo not develop noticeable symptoms.Of those who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classified as patients, most (%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mildpneumonia), while % develop severe symptoms (dyspnea,hypoxia, or more than % lung involvement on imaging), and % develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure,shock, ormultiorgan dysfunction).Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.COVID‑ transmitswhen infectious particles are breathed in or come into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. The risk is highest when people are in close proximity, but smallairborneparticles containing the virus can remain suspended in the air and travel over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur when people touch their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus. People remain contagious for up to  days and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms.Testing methods for COVID-to detect the virus\\'snucleic acidincludereal-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT‑PCR),transcription-mediated amplification,andreverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification(RT‑LAMP)from anasopharyngeal swab.SeveralCOVID- vaccineshave been approved and distributed in various countries, which have initiatedmass vaccination campaigns. Otherpreventive measuresincludephysical or social distancing,quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces,use of face masks or coveringsin public, covering coughs and sneezes,hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. While work is underway todevelop drugsthat inhibit the virus, the primarytreatmentis symptomatic. Management involves thetreatment of symptomsthroughsupportive care,isolation, andexperimental measures.NomenclatureMain article:COVID- namingDuring the initial outbreak inWuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\",with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\".In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as theSpanish flu,Middle East respiratory syndrome, andZika virus.In January , theWorld Health Organization recommended -nCoVand -nCoV acute respiratory diseaseas interim names for the virus and disease per  guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus names to preventsocial stigma.The official names COVID‑ and SARS-CoV- were issued by the WHO on  February  with COVID- being shorthand for \"coronavirus disease \".The WHO additionally uses \"the COVID‑ virus\" and \"the virus responsible for COVID‑\" in public communications.Symptoms and signsMain article:Symptoms of COVID-Symptomsof COVID-Thesymptomsof COVID- are variable depending on the type of variant contracted, ranging from mild symptoms to a potentially fatal illness.Common symptoms includecoughing,fever,loss of smell andtaste, with less common ones includingheadaches,nasal congestionandrunny nose,muscle pain,sore throat,diarrhea,eye irritation,and toes swelling or turning purple,and in moderate to severe cases,breathing difficulties.People with the COVID- infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough,sputum,shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster withmuscleand joint pain, headache, and fatigue; and a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.In people without prior ear, nose, or throat disorders,loss of tastecombined withloss of smellis associated with COVID- and is reported in as many as % of symptomatic cases.Of people who show symptoms, % develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mildpneumonia), while % develop severe symptoms (dyspnea,hypoxia, or more than % lung involvement on imaging) that require hospitalization, and % of patients develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure, septicshock, ormultiorgan dysfunction) requiring ICU admission.[needs update]At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.Theseasymptomaticcarriers tend not to get tested and can still spread the disease.Other infected people will develop symptoms later (called \"pre-symptomatic\") or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus.As is common with infections, there isa delaybetween the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. Themediandelay for COVID- is four to five dayspossibly being infectious on - of those days.Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one symptom within  days.Most people recover from theacutephase of the disease. However, some people continue to experience a range of effects, such asfatigue, for months, even after recovery.This is the result of a condition calledlong COVID, which can be described as a range of persistent symptoms that continue for weeks or months at a time.Long-term damage to organs has also been observed after the onset of COVID-. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the potential long-term effects of the disease.TheOmicron variantbecame dominant in the U.S. in December . Symptoms with the Omicron variant are less severe than they are with other variants.ComplicationsMechanisms of SARS-CoV-cytokine stormand complicationsComplications may includepneumonia,acute respiratory distress syndrome,multi-organ failure,septic shock, and death.Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure,arrhythmias(includingatrial fibrillation),heart inflammation, andthrombosis, particularlyvenous thromboembolism.Approximately –% of people who present with COVID‑ haveelevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury.Neurologic manifestations includeseizure, stroke,encephalitis, andGuillain–Barré syndrome(which includesloss of motor functions).Following the infection, children may developpaediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar toKawasaki disease, which can be fatal.In very rare cases, acuteencephalopathycan occur, and it can be considered in those who have been diagnosed with COVID‑ and have an altered mental status.According to the USCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant women are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID‑.This is because pregnant women with COVID‑ appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead tomiscarriage,premature deliveryandintrauterine growth restriction.Fungal infections such asaspergillosis,candidiasis,cryptococcosisandmucormycosishave been recorded in patients recovering from COVID‑.CauseCOVID‑ is caused by infection with astrainofcoronavirusknown as \\'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus \\' (SARS-CoV-).TransmissionMain article:Transmission of COVID-Transmissionof COVID‑COVID- is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated bydroplets/aerosolsand smallairborneparticles containing the virus. Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing.Transmission is more likely the more physically close people are. However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.The transmission of the virus is carried out through virus-laden fluid particles, or droplets, which are created in the respiratory tract, and they are expelled by the mouth and the nose. There are three types of transmission: “droplet” and “contact”, which are associated with large droplets, and “airborne”, which is associated with small droplets.If the droplets are above a certain critical size, they settle faster than theyevaporate, and therefore theycontaminatesurfaces surrounding them.Droplets that are below a certain critical size, evaporate faster than they settle; Due to that fact, they formnucleithat remain airborne for an extensive amount of time over extensive distances.Infectivitycan begin four to five days before the onset of symptoms,although contact tracing typically begins only two to three days before symptom onset.Infected people can spread the disease even if they are pre-symptomatic orasymptomatic.Most commonly, the peak viral load inupper respiratory tractsamples occurs close to the time of symptom onset and declines after the first week after symptoms begin.Current evidence suggests a duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness of up to ten days following symptom onset for people with mild to moderate COVID-, and up to  days for persons with severe COVID-, including immunocompromised people.Infectious particles range in size fromaerosolsthat remain suspended in the air for long periods of time to largerdropletsthat remain airborne briefly or fall to the ground.Additionally, COVID- research has redefined the traditional understanding of how respiratory viruses are transmitted.The largest droplets of respiratory fluid do not travel far, but can be inhaled or land on mucous membranes on the eyes, nose, or mouth to infect.Aerosols are highest in concentration when people are in close proximity, which leads to easier viral transmission when people are physically close,butairborne transmissioncan occur at longer distances, mainly in locations that are poorly ventilated;in those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.VirologyMain article:SARS-CoV-Illustration ofSARSr-CoVvirionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-) is anovelsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to theclusterof acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV- virus particle occur in relatedcoronavirusesin nature,particularly inRhinolophus sinicusaka Chinese horseshoe bats.Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap which bursts itsprotective bubble.Hospital disinfectants, alcohols, heat,povidone-iodine, andultraviolet-C(UV-C) irradiation are also effective disinfection methods for surfaces.SARS-CoV- is closely related to the originalSARS-CoV.It is thought to have an animal  origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genusBetacoronavirus, in subgenusSarbecovirus(lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is % identical at the wholegenomelevel to other bat coronavirus samples .The structural proteins of SARS-CoV- includemembrane glycoprotein,envelope protein,nucleocapsid protein, and thespike protein. The M protein of SARS-CoV- is about % similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains around % homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has % homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only around % with the M protein of MERS-CoV.SARS-CoV- variantsMain article:Variants of SARS-CoV-The many thousands of SARS-CoV- variants are grouped into eithercladesorlineages.The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV- genetic lineages byGISAID,NextstrainandPango. The expert group convened by the WHO recommended the labelling of variants using letters of theGreek alphabet, for example,Alpha,Beta,Delta, andGamma, giving the justification that they \"will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences.\"Nextstraindivides the variants into five clades (A, B, A, B, and C), whileGISAIDdivides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).The Pango tool groups variants intolineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B. lineage.Several notable variants of SARS-CoV- emerged throughout .Cluster emerged amongminksand mink farmers inDenmark.After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, the cluster was assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in Denmark as of  February .As of December\\xa0[update], there are five dominant variants of SARS-CoV- spreading among global populations: theAlpha variant(B..., formerly called the UK variant), first found in London and Kent, theBeta variant(B.., formerly called the South Africa variant), theGamma variant(P., formerly called the Brazil variant), theDelta variant(B..., formerly called the India variant),and theOmicron variant(B...), which had spread to  countries as of  December.PathophysiologyCOVID‑pathogenesisThe SARS-CoV- virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. COVID‑ is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑ because the virus accesses host cells via thereceptorfor the enzymeangiotensin-converting enzyme , which is most abundant on the surface oftype II alveolar cellsof the lungs.The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE receptor and enter the host cell.Respiratory tractFollowing viral entry, COVID‑ infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways.Nervous systemOne common symptom, loss of smell, results frominfection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to theolfactory neurons.The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in COVID‑ has been reported in many medical publications.It is clear that many people withCOVID- exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in thecentral nervous system of the majority of COVID- patients withneurological issues. However, SARS-CoV- has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑, but these results need to be confirmed.While virus has been detected incerebrospinal fluidof autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE in the brain.The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood–brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell.Tropismandmultiple organ injuriesin SARS-CoV- infectionResearch conducted when Alpha was the dominant variant has suggested COVID- may cause brain damage. It is unknown if such damage is temporary or permanent, and whether Omicron has similar effects.Observed individuals infected with COVID- (most with mild cases) experienced an additional .% to % of brain tissue lost in regions of the brain connected to the sense of smell compared with uninfected individuals, and the overall effect on the brain was equivalent on average to at least one extra year of normal ageing; infected individuals also scored lower on several cognitive tests. All effects were more pronounced among older ages.Gastrointestinal tractThe virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE is abundantly expressed in theglandularcells ofgastric,duodenalandrectalepitheliumas well asendothelialcells andenterocytesof thesmall intestine.Cardiovascular systemThe virus can causeacute myocardial injuryand chronic damage to thecardiovascular system.An acute cardiac injury was found in % of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China,and is more frequent in severe disease.Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE receptors in the heart.ACE receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.A high incidence ofthrombosisandvenous thromboembolismoccurs in people transferred tointensive care unitswith COVID‑ infections, and may be related to poor prognosis.Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by highD-dimerlevels caused by blood clots) may have a significant role in mortality, incidents of clots leading topulmonary embolisms, andischaemic events within the brain found as complications leading to death in people infected with COVID‑.Infection may initiate a chain ofvasoconstrictive responseswithin the body, including pulmonary vasoconstriction – a possible mechanism in which oxygenation decreases during pneumonia.Furthermore, damage ofarteriolesandcapillarieswas found in brain tissue samples of people who died from COVID‑.COVID‑ may also cause substantial structural changes toblood cells, sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge.A low level of blood lymphocytesmay result from the virus acting through ACE-related entry into lymphocytes.Other organsAnother common cause of death is complications related to thekidneys.Early reports show that up to % of hospitalised patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑ have founddiffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.ImmunopathologyKey components of theadaptive immune responseto SARS-CoV-Although SARS-CoV- has a tropism for ACE-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑ have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevatedIL‑,IL‑,IL‑,granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor(GM‑CSF),interferon gamma-induced protein(IP‑),monocyte chemoattractant protein,macrophage inflammatory protein ‑alpha(MIP‑‑alpha), andtumour necrosis factor(TNF‑α) indicative ofcytokine release syndrome suggest an underlying immunopathology.Interferon alphaplays a complex, Janus-faced role in the pathogenesis of COVID-. Although it promotes the elimination of virus-infected cells, it also upregulates the expression of ACE-, thereby facilitating the SARS-Cov virus to enter cells and to replicate.A competition of negative feedback loops (via protective effects of interferon alpha) and positive feedback loops (via upregulation of ACE-) is assumed to determine the fate of patients suffering from COVID-.Additionally, people with COVID‑ andacute respiratory distress syndrome have classicalserumbiomarkersof CRS, including elevatedC-reactive protein,lactate dehydrogenase,D-dimer, andferritin.Systemic inflammation results invasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secretingT\\xa0cellswere shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL--secretingmonocytesand severe lung pathology in people with COVID‑.Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.Viral and host factorsVirus proteinsThe association between SARS-CoV- and theRenin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone SystemMultiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus. The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via theACEreceptors. It includes two subunits: S and S. S determines the virus-host range and cellular tropism via the receptor-binding domain. S mediates the membrane fusion of the virus to its potential cell host via the H and HR, which areheptad repeatregions. Studies have shown that S domain inducedIgGandIgAantibody levels at a much higher capacity. It is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective COVID‑ vaccines.The M protein is the viral protein responsible for the transmembrane transport of nutrients. It is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope.The N and E protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the host\\'s immune response.Host factorsHumanangiotensin converting enzyme  is the host factor that SARS-CoV- virus targets causing COVID‑. Theoretically, the usage ofangiotensin receptor blockers andACE inhibitorsupregulating ACE expression might increasemorbiditywith COVID‑, though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of ARB; however no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes. Until further data is available, guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain.The effect of the virus on ACE cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration, increased blood vessel permeability, alveolar wall permeability, as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants. These effects cause the majority of the respiratory symptoms. However, the aggravation of local inflammation causes a cytokine storm eventually leading to asystemic inflammatory response syndrome.Among healthy adults not exposed to SARS-CoV-, about % haveCD+T cellsthat recognise the SARS-CoV-S protein(particularly the S subunit) and about % react to other proteins of the virus, suggestingcross-reactivityfrom previouscommon coldscaused by other coronaviruses.It is unknown whether different persons use similar antibody genes in response to COVID‑.Host cytokine responseMild versus severeimmune responseduringvirus infectionThe severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as thecytokine storm.Levels ofinterleukinB,interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein , and monocyte chemoattractant protein were all associated with COVID‑ disease severity. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes ofmorbidityand mortality in COVID‑ disease.A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID‑, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality. The storm causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, blood clotting events such as strokes, myocardial infarction,encephalitis,acute kidney injury, andvasculitis. The production ofIL-,IL-,IL-,TNF-alpha, andinterferon-gamma, all crucial components of normal immune responses, inadvertently become the causes of a cytokine storm. The cells of thecentral nervous system, themicroglia,neurons, andastrocytes, are also involved in the release ofpro-inflammatory cytokinesaffecting the nervous system, and effects of cytokine storms toward theCNSare not uncommon.Pregnancy responseThere are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID- pandemic. Given that they are prone to have complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures.Physiological responses to pregnancy can include:Immunological: The immunological response to COVID-, like other viruses, depends on a working immune system. It adapts during pregnancy to allow the development of the foetus whose genetic load is only partially shared with their mother, leading to a different immunological reaction to infections during the course of pregnancy.Respiratory: Many factors can make pregnant women more vulnerable to hard respiratory infections. One of them is the total reduction of the lungs\\' capacity and inability to clear secretions.Coagulation: During pregnancy, there are higher levels of circulating coagulation factors, and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV- infection can be implicated. The thromboembolic events with associated mortality are a risk for pregnant women.However, from the evidence base, it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of grave consequences of this virus.In addition to the above, other clinical studies have proved that SARS-CoV- can affect the period of pregnancy in different ways. On the one hand, there is little evidence of its impact up to  weeks gestation. On the other hand, COVID- infection may cause increased rates of unfavourable outcomes in the course of the pregnancy. Some examples of these could be foetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, which refers to the foetal death past  or  completed weeks of pregnancy as well as the death among live-born children up to seven completed days of life.For preterm birth, a  review indicates that there appears to be a correlation with COVID-.Unvaccinated women in later stages of pregnancy with COVID- are more likely than other patients to need very intensive care. Babies born to mothers with COVID- are more likely to have breathing problems. Pregnant women are strongly encouraged to getvaccinated.DiagnosisFurther information:COVID- testingCOVID‑ can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed usingreverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) or othernucleic acidtesting of infected secretions.Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑ in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection.Detection of a past infection is possible withserological tests, which detectantibodiesproduced by the body in response to the infection.Viral testingMain article:COVID- testingDemonstration of anasopharyngeal swabforCOVID‑ testingThe standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV- arenucleic acid tests,which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.\"The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by anasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.Results are generally available within hours.The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.Several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. Several have been evaluated byPublic Health Englandand approved for use in the UK.TheUniversity of Oxford\\'s CEBM has pointed to mounting evidencethat \"a good proportion of \\'new\\' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\" and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\"In September , the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV- RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\".ImagingACTscan of a person with COVID- shows lesions (bright regions) in the lungsCT scan of rapid progression stage of COVID-Chest X-ray showing COVID‑ pneumoniaChest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑ in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening.Bilateral multilobarground-glass opacitieswith a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection.Subpleural dominance,crazy paving(lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), andconsolidationmay appear as the disease progresses.Characteristic imaging features on chestradiographsandcomputed tomography of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities withoutpleural effusions.Many groups have createdCOVID‑ datasetsthat include imagery such as theItalian Radiological Societywhich has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.Due to overlap with other infections such asadenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limitedspecificityin identifying COVID‑.A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and moresensitive.CodingIn late , the WHO assigned emergencyICD-disease codes U. for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV- infection and U. for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID‑ without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV- infection.PathologyThe main pathological findings at autopsy are:Macroscopy:pericarditis,lung consolidationandpulmonary oedemaLung findings:minor serousexudation, minorfibrinexudationpulmonary oedema,pneumocytehyperplasia, large atypicalpneumocytes, interstitialinflammationwithlymphocyticinfiltrationandmultinucleated giant cellformationdiffuse alveolar damage with diffusealveolarexudates.

The valves are a weak point that can transmit the viruses outwards.The WHO and the US CDC recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.A face covering without vents or holes will also filter out particles containing the virus from inhaled and exhaled air, reducing the chances of infection.However, if the mask includes anexhalation valve, a wearer that is infected (and possibly asymptomatic) may transmit the virus through the valve. Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease.When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available. Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged. Healthcare professionals interacting directly with people who have COVID‑ are advised to userespiratorsat least as protective asNIOSH-certifiedNor equivalent, in addition to otherpersonal protective equipment.Indoor ventilation and avoiding crowded indoor spacesThe CDC recommends that crowded indoor spaces should be avoided.When indoors, increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air can reduce transmission.The WHO recommendsventilationandair filtrationin public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols.Exhaled respiratory particles can build-up within enclosed spaces with inadequateventilation. The risk of COVID‑ infection increases especially in spaces where people engage in physical exertion or raise their voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing) as this increases exhalation of respiratory droplets. Prolonged exposure to these conditions, typically more than  minutes, leads to higher risk of infection.Displacement ventilationwith large natural inlets can move stale air directly to the exhaust inlaminar flowwhile significantly reducing the concentration of droplets and particles.Passive ventilationreduces energy consumption and maintenance costs but may lackcontrollabilityandheat recovery. Displacement ventilation can also be achieved mechanically with higher energy and maintenance costs. The use of large ducts and openings helps to prevent mixing in closed environments. Recirculation and mixing should be avoided because recirculation prevents dilution of harmful particles and redistributes possibly contaminated air, and mixing increases the concentration and range of infectious particles and keeps larger particles in the air.Hand-washing and hygieneMain article:Hand washingStudents inRwandahand washing and wearing face masks during theCOVID‑ pandemic in the country.Thorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required.The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one\\'s nose.When soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-basedhand sanitiserwith at least % alcohol.For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production. In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises fromethanolorisopropanol.Hydrogen peroxideis used to help eliminatebacterial sporesin the alcohol; it is \"not an active substance for handantisepsis.\"Glycerolis added as ahumectant.Social distancingMain article:Social distancing measures related to the COVID- pandemicSocial distancing (also known as physical distancing) includesinfection controlactions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.Many governments are mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.Outbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing.In the United States, the prisoner population is ageing and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID‑ due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease, and poor access to high-quality healthcare.Surface cleaningAfter being expelled from the body, coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days. If a person touches the dirty surface, they may deposit the virus at the eyes, nose, or mouth where it can enter the body and cause infection.Evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of COVID‑,leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase ofantimicrobial resistancethrough the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes.Deep cleaningand other surface sanitation has been criticised ashygiene theatre, giving a false sense of security against something primarily spread through the air.The amount of time that the virus can survive depends significantly on the type of surface, the temperature, and the humidity.Coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to theUV lightinsunlight.Like other enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV- survives longest when the temperature is atroom temperatureor lower, and when therelative humidityis low (<%).On many surfaces, including glass, some types of plastic, stainless steel, and skin, the virus can remain infective for several days indoors at room temperature, or even about a week under ideal conditions.On some surfaces, including cotton fabric and copper, the virus usually dies after a few hours.The virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on non-porous surfaces due to capillary action within pores and faster aerosol droplet evaporation.However, of the many surfaces tested, two with the longest survival times are N respirator masks and surgical masks, both of which are considered porous surfaces.The CDC says that in most situations, cleaning surfaces with soap or detergent, not disinfecting, is enough to reduce risk of transmission.The CDC recommends that if a COVID‑ case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by the ill persons should be disinfected.Surfaces may be decontaminated with – per centethanol, – per cent isopropanol, . per centsodium hypochlorite, . per cent hydrogen peroxide, .–. per centpovidone-iodine, or – ppmhypochlorous acid. Other solutions, such asbenzalkonium chlorideandchlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.Ultraviolet germicidal irradiationmay also be used,although popular devices require–\\xa0minexposure and may deteriorate some materials over time.A datasheet comprising the authorised substances to disinfection in the food industry (including suspension or surface tested, kind of surface, use dilution, disinfectant and inoculum volumes) can be seen in the supplementary material of.Self-isolationSelf-isolationat home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID‑ and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups.Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID‑ and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for  days from the time of last possible exposure.International travel-related control measuresA  Cochrane rapid review found that based upon low-certainty evidence, international travel-related control measures such as restricting cross-border travel may help to contain the spread of COVID‑.Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases.While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up. The review concluded that a minimum -day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID‑ and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening.TreatmentMain article:Treatment and management of COVID-An overview of COVID- therapeutics and drugsAlthough several medications have been approved in different countries as of April , not all countries have these medications. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms who are in the risk groups can takenirmatrelvir/ritonavir(marketed as Paxlovid) orremdesivir, either of which reduces the risk of serious illness or hospitalization.In the US, theBiden Administration COVID- action planincludes the Test to Treat initiative, where people can go to a pharmacy, take a COVID test, and immediately receive free Paxlovid if they test positive.Highly effective vaccines have reduced mortality related to SARS-CoV-; however, for those awaiting vaccination, as well as for the estimated millions of immunocompromised persons who are unlikely to respond robustly to vaccination, treatment remains important.The cornerstone ofmanagement of COVID-has beensupportive care, which includes treatment torelieve symptoms,fluid therapy,oxygen supportandprone positioningas needed, and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs.Most cases of COVID- are mild. In these, supportive care includes medication such asparacetamolorNSAIDsto relieve symptoms (fever, body aches, cough), proper intake of fluids, rest, andnasal breathing.Good personal hygiene and ahealthy dietare also recommended.As of April  the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that those who suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at home and wear a face mask.As of November  use of theglucocorticoiddexamethasonehad been strongly recommended in those severe cases treated in hospital with low oxygen levels, to reduce the risk of death.Noninvasive ventilationand, ultimately, admission to anintensive care unitformechanical ventilationmay be required to support breathing.Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been used to address  respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.Some of the cases of severe disease course are caused by systemic hyper-inflammation, the so-calledcytokine storm.Prognosis and risk factorsSee also:COVID- pandemic death rates by countryThe severity of COVID‑ varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as thecommon cold. In –% of cases (.% for those over age ) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalisation.Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks.The ItalianIstituto Superiore di Sanitàreported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being hospitalised. However, people transferred to an ICU had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death.Abnormal sodium levels during hospitalisation with COVID- are associated with poor prognoses: high sodium with a greater risk of death, and low sodium with an increased chance of needing ventilator support.Prolongedprothrombintime and elevatedC-reactive proteinlevels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID‑ and with a transfer to ICU.Some early studies suggest % to % of people with COVID‑ will experiencesymptoms lasting longer than a month.A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath.On  October , WHO chiefTedros Adhanomwarned that \"to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects.\" He has described the vast spectrum of COVID‑ symptoms that fluctuate over time as \"really concerning\". They range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs\\xa0– including the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic effects. Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body. Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms. Tedros therefore concluded that a strategy of achievingherd immunityby infection, rather than vaccination, is \"morally unconscionable and unfeasible\".In terms of hospital readmissions about % of , individuals had to return for hospital treatment within two months of discharge. The average to readmit was eight days since first hospital visit. There are several risk factors that have been identified as being a cause of multiple admissions to a hospital facility. Among these are advanced age (above  years of age) and presence of a chronic condition such as diabetes, COPD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease.According toscientific reviewssmokers are more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.Acting on the same ACE pulmonary receptors affected by smoking, air pollution has been correlated with the disease.Short termand chronicexposure to air pollution seems to enhance morbidity and mortality from COVID‑.Pre-existing heart and lung diseasesand alsoobesity, especially in conjunction withfatty liver disease, contributes to an increased health risk of COVID‑.It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-.One research study that looked into the COVID‑ infections in hospitalised kidney transplant recipients found a mortality rate of %.Men with untreatedhypogonadismwere . times more likely than men with eugonadism to be hospitalised if they contracted COVID-; Hypogonad men treated withtestosteronewere less likely to be hospitalised for COVID- than men who were not treated for hypogonadism.Genetic risk factorsGeneticsplays an important role in the ability to fight off Covid.For instance, those that do not produce detectabletype I interferonsor produceauto-antibodiesagainst these may get much sicker from COVID‑.Genetic screeningis able to detect interferon effector genes.Some genetic variants are risk factors in specific populations. For instance, andalleleof theDOCKgene (dedicator of cytokinesis  gene) is a common risk factor in Asian populations but much less common in Europe. The mutation leads to lower expression of DOCK especially in younger patients with severe Covid.In fact, many other genes and genetic variants have been found that determine the outcome of SARS-CoV- infections.ChildrenSee also:Impact of the COVID- pandemic on childrenWhile very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole.Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults.The CDC reports that in the US roughly a third of hospitalised children were admitted to the ICU,while a European multinational study of hospitalised children from June , found that about % of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care.Four of the  children (.%) in the European study died, but the actual mortality rate may be \"substantially lower\" since milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study.Longer-term effectsFurther information:Long COVIDSome early studies suggest that –% of people with COVID‑ will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month.A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems, including fatigue and shortness of breath.About –% of patients admitted to hospital progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.By a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID‑.In people requiring hospital admission, up to % of CT scans performed show lung abnormalities after  days of illness even if they had clinically improved.People with advanced age, severe disease, prolonged ICU stays, or who smoke are more likely to have long-lasting effects, including pulmonary fibrosis.Overall, approximately one-third of those investigated after four weeks will have findings ofpulmonary fibrosisor reduced lung function as measured byDLCO, even in asymptomatic people, but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more time.After severe disease, lung function can take anywhere from three months to a year or more to return to previous levels.The risks ofcognitive deficit,dementia, psychotic disorders, andepilepsyor seizures persists at an increased level two years after infection.ImmunitySee also:COVID- vaccineHumanantibody responseto SARS-CoV- infectionTheimmune responseby humans to SARS-CoV- virus occurs as a combination of thecell-mediated immunityand antibody production,just as with most other infections.B cells interact with T cells and begin dividing before selection into the plasma cell, partly on the basis of their affinity for antigen.Since SARS-CoV- has been in the human population only since December , it remains unknown if theimmunityis long-lasting in people who recover from the disease.The presence of neutralising antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection, but the level of neutralising antibody declines with time. Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralising antibody two months after infection. In another study, the level of neutralising antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms. However, the lack of antibodies in the blood does not mean antibodies will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to SARS-CoV-. Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV- last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms.As of August , reinfection with COVID‑ was possible but uncommon. The first case of reinfection was documented in August .A systematic review found  cases of confirmed reinfection in medical literature as of May .With theOmicron variant, as of , reinfections have become common, albeit it is unclear how common.COVID- reinfectionsare thought to likely be less severe than primary infections, especially if one was previously infected by the same variant.[additional citation needed]MortalityMain articles:COVID- pandemicandCOVID- pandemic death rates by countrySeveral measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.Themortality ratereflects the number of deaths within a specific demographic group divided by the population of that demographic group. Consequently, the mortality rate reflects the prevalence as well as the severity of the disease within a given population. Mortality rates are highly correlated to age, with relatively low rates for young people and relatively high rates among the elderly.In fact, one relevant factor of mortality rates is the age structure of the countries\\' populations. For example, the case fatality rate for COVID‑ is lower in India than in the US since India\\'s younger population represents a larger percentage than in the US.Case fatality rateThecase fatality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is.% (,,/,,) as of  March .The number varies by region.Total confirmed cases over timeTotal confirmed cases of COVID‑ per million peopleTotal confirmed deaths over timeTotal confirmed deaths due to COVID‑ per million peopleInfection fatality rateA key metric in gauging the severity of COVID‑ is theinfection fatality rate, also referred to as theinfection fatality ratioorinfection fatality risk.This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to theCFR, the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases.EstimatesThe red line shows the estimate of infection fatality rate , in percentage terms, as a function of age. The shaded region depicts the % confidence interval for that estimate. Markers denotes specific observations used in the meta-analysis.The same relationship plotted on a log scaleA December  systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that population IFR during the first wave of the pandemic was about .% to % in many locations (including France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), % to % in other locations (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and exceeded % in Italy.That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., .% at age  and .% at age ) but increases progressively to .% at age , .% at age , .% at age , and % at age .These results were also highlighted in a December  report issued by the WHO.IFR estimate per age group(to December )Age groupIFR–.%–.%–.%–.%–.%–.%\\u2009+.%An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID‑ is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate of COVID- is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualised risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonalinfluenza.Earlier estimates of IFRAt an early stage of the pandemic, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between .% and %.On July, The WHO\\'s chief scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about .%.In August, the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately .–%.Firm lower limits of IFRs have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot be less than the population fatality rate. (After sufficient time however, people can get reinfected).As of  July, in New York City, with a population of .\\xa0million, , individuals (, confirmed and , probable) have died with COVID‑ (.% of the population).Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of ≈.%,and ≈.%.InBergamo province, .% of the population has died.In September , the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported preliminary estimates of age-specific IFRs for public health planning purposes.Sex differencesMain article:Gendered impact of the COVID- pandemicEstimated prognosis by age and sexbased on cases fromFranceandDiamond Princess shipPercentage of infected people who are hospitalised–––––––+TotalFemale.(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.)Male.(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.)Total.(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.)Percentage of hospitalised people who go to Intensive Care Unit–––––––+TotalFemale.(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.)Male.(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.)Total.(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.)Percent of hospitalised people who die–––––––+TotalFemale.(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.)Male.(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.)Total.(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.)Percent of infected people who die\\xa0– infection fatality rate –––––––+TotalFemale.(<.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.)Male.(<.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.)Total.(<.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.).(.–.)Numbers in parentheses are %credible intervalsfor the estimates.COVID‑case fatality ratesare higher among men than women in most countries. However, in a few countries like India, Nepal, Vietnam, and Slovenia the fatality cases are higher in women than men.Globally, men are more likely to be admitted to theICUand more likely to die.One meta-analysis found that globally, men were more likely to get COVID‑ than women; there were approximately  men and  women per  infections (CI: .–.).TheChinese Center for Disease Control and Preventionreported the death rate was .% for men and .% for women.Later reviews in June  indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in CFR between genders.One review acknowledges the different mortality rates in Chinese men, suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors.Smoking, which in some countries like China is mainly a male activity, is a habit that contributes to increasing significantly the case fatality rates among men.Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men.In Europe as of February , % of the infected people were men and % of those died with COVID‑ were men.As of April , the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID‑ infections.Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.Ethnic differencesIn the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID‑ have occurred among African Americans and other minority groups.Structural factors that prevent them from practising social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in \"essential\" occupations such as retail grocery workers, public transit employees, health-care workers and custodial staff. Greater prevalence of lackinghealth insuranceand care of underlying conditions such asdiabetes,hypertension, andheart diseasealso increase their risk of death.Similar issues affectNative AmericanandLatinocommunities.On the one hand, in the Dominican Republic there is a clear example of both gender and ethnic inequality. In this Latin American territory, there is great inequality and precariousness that especially affects Dominican women, with greater emphasis on those of Haitian descent.According to a US health policy non-profit, % of American Indian and Alaska Native People  non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to % of white non-elderly adults.The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water.Leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities.In the UK, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID‑ have occurred in those of aBlack,Asian, and other ethnic minority background.More severe impacts upon patients including the relative incidence of the necessity of hospitalisation requirements, and vulnerability to the disease has been associated via DNA analysis to be expressed in genetic variants at chromosomal region , features that are associated with EuropeanNeanderthalheritage. That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease.The findings are from Professor Svante Pääbo and researchers he leads at theMax Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropologyand theKarolinska Institutet.This admixture of modern human and Neanderthal genes is estimated to have occurred roughly between , and , years ago in Southern Europe.ComorbiditiesBiologicalfactors (immune response) and the general behaviour  can strongly determine the consequences of COVID‑.Most of those who die of COVID‑ havepre-existing  conditions, including hypertension,diabetes mellitus,andcardiovascular disease.According to March data from the United States, % of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions.The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of .% of deaths wheremedical chartswere available, .% of people had at least onecomorbiditywith the average person having . diseases.According to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension (% of deaths),type\\xa0 diabetes(.% of deaths),ischaemic heart disease(.% of deaths),atrial fibrillation(.% of deaths) andchronic renal failure(.% of deaths).Most critical respiratory comorbidities according to the USCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, are: moderate or severeasthma, pre-existingCOPD,pulmonary fibrosis,cystic fibrosis.Evidence stemming frommeta-analysisof several smaller research papers also suggests that smoking can be associated with worse outcomes.When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms.COVID‑ also poses a greater risk to people whomisuse opioidsandamphetamines, insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage.In August , the CDC issued a caution thattuberculosis infections could increase the risk of severe illness or death. The WHO recommended that people with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for COVID‑ could not rule out co-infections. Some projections have estimated that reduced TB detection due to the pandemic could result in .\\xa0million additional TB cases and .\\xa0million TB-related deaths by .HistoryMain articles:Timeline of

People\\'s Republic of China and theWorld Health Organizationindicated that the virus descended from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and likely spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host.There are several theories about where theindex caseoriginated andinvestigations into the origin of the pandemicare ongoing.According to articles published in July  inScience, virus transmission into humans occurred through two spillover events in November  and was likely due to live wildlife trade on theHuanan wet marketin the city ofWuhan(Hubei, China).Doubts about the conclusions have mostly centered on the precise site of spillover.Earlierphylogeneticsestimated that SARS-CoV- arose in October or November .A phylogenetic algorithm analysis suggested that the virus may have been circulating inGuangdongbefore Wuhan.Most scientists believe the virus spilled into human populations through naturalzoonosis, similar to theSARS-CoV-andMERS-CoVoutbreaks, and consistent with other pandemics in human history.According to theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeseveral social and environmental factors includingclimate change,natural ecosystem destructionandwildlife tradeincreased the likelihood of suchzoonotic spillover.One study made with the support of theEuropean Unionfoundclimate changeincreased the likelihood of the pandemic by influencing distribution of bat species.Available evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV- virus was originally harboured by bats, and spread to humans multiple times from infected wild animals at theHuanan Seafood MarketinWuhanin December .A minority of scientists and some members of theU.S intelligence communitybelieve the virus may have beenunintentionally leakedfrom a laboratory such as theWuhan Institute of Virology.The US intelligence community has mixed views on the issue,but overall agrees with the scientific consensus that the virus was not developed as abiological weaponand is unlikely to have beengenetically engineered.There is no evidence SARS-CoV- existed in any laboratory prior to the pandemic.The first confirmed human infections were in Wuhan. A study of the first  cases of confirmed COVID‑, published in January  inThe Lancet, reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as December .Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as December .Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by  January .According to official Chinese sources, these were mostly linked to theHuanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.In May ,George Gao, the director of the CDC, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating that the market was the site of an earlysuperspreading event, but that it was not the site of the initial outbreak.Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater samples that were collected inMilanandTurin, Italy, on  December .By December , the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.The number of COVID- cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by  December,and at least  by  December.On  December,Wuhan Central Hospitalsent abronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On  and  December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on  December and treated by the doctorZhang Jixianin Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on  December.On  December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result forSARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on \"the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause\" that same evening.Eight of these doctors, includingLi Wenliang(punished on January),were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours and another,Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on  December, confirming  cases– enough to trigger an investigation.During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.In early and mid-January , the virus spread to otherChinese provinces, helped by theChinese New Year migrationand Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.On  January, China reported nearly  new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one inShenzhen.Later official data shows , people had already developed symptoms by then,and more may have been infected.A report inThe Lanceton  January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its \"pandemic potential\".On  January, the WHO declared COVID- aPublic Health Emergency of International Concern.By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of  to  times.Italy had its first confirmed cases on  January , two tourists from China.Italy overtook China as the country with the most deaths on  March .By  March the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID- cases inNew Yorkcame from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on  December ,and a person in the United States who died from the disease on February .RT-PCR testing of untreated wastewater samples from Brazil and Italy have suggested detection of SARS-CoV- as early as November and December , respectively, but the methods of such sewage studies have not been optimised, many have not been peer-reviewed, details are often missing, and there is a risk of false positives due to contamination or if only one gene target is detected.A September  review journal article said, \"The possibility that the COVID‑ infection had already spread to Europe at the end of last year is now indicated by abundant, even if partially circumstantial, evidence,\" including pneumonia case numbers and radiology in France and Italy in November and December.As of \\xa0October\\xa0[update],Reutersreported that it had estimated the worldwide total number of deaths due to COVID‑ to have exceeded five million.MisinformationMain article:COVID- misinformationAfter the initial outbreak of COVID‑,misinformationanddisinformationregarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online.In September , the USCenters for Disease Control and Prevention published preliminary estimates of the risk of death by age groups in the United States, but those estimates were widely misreported and misunderstood.Other speciesSee also:Impact of the COVID- pandemic on animalsHumans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals,a type of disease transmission referred to aszooanthroponosis.Some pets, especially cats andferrets, can catch this virus from infected humans.Symptoms in cats includerespiratory(such as a cough) and digestive symptoms.Cats can spread the virus to other cats, and may be able to spread the virus to humans, but cat-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV- has not been proven.Compared to cats, dogs are less susceptible to this infection.Behaviours which increase the risk of transmission include kissing, licking, and petting the animal.The virus does not appear to be able to infectpigs,ducks, or chickens at all.Mice, rats, and rabbits, if they can be infected at all, are unlikely to be involved in spreading the virus.Tigers and lions in zoos have become infected as a result of contact with infected humans.As expected, monkeys andgreat apespecies such asorangutanscan also be infected with the COVID‑ virus.Minks, which are in thesame familyas ferrets, have been infected.Minks may be asymptomatic, and can also spread the virus to humans.Multiple countries have identified infected animals inmink farms.Denmark, a major producer of mink pelts, ordered the slaughter of all minks over fears of viral mutations,following an outbreak referred to asCluster . A vaccine for mink and other animals is being researched.ResearchFurther information:COVID- drug developmentInternational research on vaccines and medicines in COVID‑ is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers.The CDC has classified it to require aBSLgrade laboratory.There has been a great deal of COVID‑ research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand.As of December\\xa0[update], hundreds ofclinical trialshave been undertaken, with research happening on every continent exceptAntarctica.As of November\\xa0[update], more than  possible treatments have been studied in humans.Transmission and prevention researchFurther information:COVID- vaccineModellingresearch has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of transmission,diagnosis and prognosis of infection,estimation of the impact of interventions,or allocation of resources.Modelling studies are mostly based oncompartmental models in epidemiology,estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions. Several other types of models have been developed and used during the COVID‑ pandemic includingcomputational fluid dynamicsmodels to study the flow physics of COVID‑,retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant exposure,mobility-data based models to investigate transmission,or the use ofmacroeconomicmodels to assess the economic impact of the pandemic.Treatment-related researchMain article:COVID- drug repurposing researchSeven possible drug targets in viral replication process and drugsRepurposedantiviral drugsmake up most of the research into COVID‑ treatments.Other candidates in trials includevasodilators,corticosteroids, immune therapies,lipoic acid,bevacizumab, andrecombinantangiotensin-converting enzyme .In March , theWorld Health Organization initiated theSolidarity trialto assess the treatment effects of some promising drugs: anexperimental drugcalled remdesivir;anti-malarialdrugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; twoanti-HIV drugs,lopinavir/ritonavir; andinterferon-beta.More than  active clinical trials are underway as of April .Research on the antimalarial drugshydroxychloroquineandchloroquineshowed that they were ineffective at best,and that they may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir.By May [update], France, Italy, and Belgium had banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID‑ treatment.In June, initial results from the randomisedRECOVERY Trialin the United Kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one third for people who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental oxygen.Because this is a well-tested and widely available treatment, it was welcomed by the WHO, which is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone and other steroids.Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the NIH for patients with COVID‑ who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID‑ who do not require supplemental oxygen.In September , the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID‑.The WHO recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and critical COVID‑ (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence).The WHO suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with non-severe COVID‑ (conditional recommendation, based on low certainty evidence).The updated guidance was based on a meta-analysis of clinical trials of critically ill COVID‑ patients.In September , theEuropean Medicines Agency endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents from twelve years of age and weighing at least  kilograms (\\xa0lb) who require supplemental oxygen therapy.Dexamethasone can be takenby mouthor given as an injection orinfusion  into a vein.In November , the USFood and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorisation for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapybamlanivimabfor the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID‑.Bamlanivimab is authorised for people with positive results of direct SARS-CoV- viral testing who are twelve years of age and older weighing at least  kilograms (\\xa0lb), and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID‑ or hospitalisation.This includes those who are  years of age or older, or who have chronic medical conditions.In February , the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation  for bamlanivimab andetesevimabadministered together for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID‑ in people twelve years of age or older weighing at least  kilograms (\\xa0lb) who test positive for SARS‑CoV‑ and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID‑. The authorised use includes treatment for those who are  years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions.In April , the FDA revoked the emergency use authorisation  that allowed for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab, when administered alone, to be used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID‑ in adults and certain paediatric patients.Cytokine stormVarious therapeutic strategies for targeting cytokine stormAcytokine stormcan be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID‑. A cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction where a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines andchemokinesare released too quickly. A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure.Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID‑ had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses. These high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a cytokine storm.Tocilizumabhas been included in treatment guidelines by China\\'sNational Health Commissionafter a small study was completed.It is undergoing aPhaseIInon-randomised trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.Theinterleukin- receptor(IL-R)antagonistwas approved by the FDA to undergo a PhaseIII clinical trial assessing its effectiveness on COVID‑ based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause,CAR T celltherapy, in .There is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS. Prophylactic tocilizumab has been shown to increase serum IL- levels by saturating the IL-R, driving IL- across theblood–brain barrier, and exacerbatingneurotoxicitywhile having no effect on the incidence of CRS.Lenzilumab, an anti-GM-CSFmonoclonal antibody, is protective in murine models for CAR T cell-induced CRS and neurotoxicity and is a viable therapeutic option due to the observed increase of pathogenic GM-CSF secreting Tcells in hospitalised patients with COVID‑.Passive antibodiesOverview of the application and use ofconvalescent plasmatherapyTransferring purified and concentratedantibodiesproduced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID‑ to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method ofpassive immunisation.[needs update]Viral neutralisationis the anticipatedmechanism of actionby which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-. The spike protein of SARS-CoV- is the primary target for neutralising antibodies.As of August , eight neutralising antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV- have entered clinical studies.It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID‑ but also future SARS-related CoV infections.Other mechanisms, however, such asantibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicityorphagocytosis, may be possible.Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID‑ is also being studied. This involves the production ofconvalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to this virus, which is then administered to active patients.This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.An updated Cochrane review in May  found high certainty evidence that, for the treatment of people with moderate to severe COVID‑, convalescent plasma did not reduce mortality or bring about symptom improvement.There continues to be uncertainty about the safety of convalescent plasma administration to people with COVID‑ and differing outcomes measured in different studies limits their use in determining efficacy.BioethicsSince the outbreak of the COVID‑ pandemic, scholars have explored thebioethics,normative economics, andpolitical theoriesofhealthcare policiesrelated to the public health crisis.Academics have pointed to the moral distress of healthcare workers, ethics of distributing scarce healthcare resources such as ventilators,and the global justice of vaccine diplomacies.[citation needed]The socio-economic inequalities between genders,races,groups with disabilities,communities,regions, countries,and continents have also drawn attention in academia and the general public.Effects on other diseasesThe use ofsocial distancingand the wearing ofsurgical masksand similar precautions against COVID‑ may have caused a drop in the spread of thecommon coldand theflu.See alsoCoronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromesDisease X, a WHO termLaw of declining virulence– Disproved hypothesis of epidemiologist Theobald SmithTheory of virulence– Theory by biologist Paul W.
